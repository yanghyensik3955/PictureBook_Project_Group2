"far out in the wide sea where the water is blue as the loveliest cornflower and clear as the purest crystal where it is so deep that very very many church-towers must be heaped one upon another in order to reach from the lowest depth to the surface above dwell the mer-people  now you must not imagine that there is nothing but sand below the water  no indeed far from it trees and plants of wondrous beauty grow there whose stems and leaves are so light that they are waved to and fro by the slightest motion of the water almost as if they were living beings fishes great and small glide in and out among the branches just as birds fly about among our trees  where the water is deepest stands the palace of the mer-king the walls of this palace are of coral and the high pointed windows are of amber the roof however is composed of mussel-shells which as the billows pass over them are continually opening and shutting this looks exceedingly pretty especially as each of these mussel-shells contains a number of bright glittering pearls one only of which would be the most costly ornament in the diadem of a king in the upper world  the mer-king who lived in this palace had been for many years a widower his old mother managed the household affairs for him she was on the whole a sensible sort of a lady although extremely proud of her high birth and station on which account she wore twelve oysters on her tail whilst the other inhabitants of the sea even those of distinction were allowed only six in every other respect she merited unlimited praise especially for the affection she showed to the six little princesses her grand-daughters these were all very beautiful children the youngest was however the most lovely her skin was as soft and delicate as a rose-leaf her eyes were of as deep a blue as the sea but like all other mermaids she had no feet her body ended in a tail like that of a fish  the whole day long the children used to play in the spacious apartments of the palace where beautiful flowers grew out of the walls on all sides around them when the great amber windows were opened fishes would swim into these apartments as swallows fly into our rooms but the fishes were bolder than the swallows they swam straight up to the little princesses ate from their hands and allowed themselves to be caressed  in front of the palace there was a large garden full of fiery red and dark blue trees whose fruit glittered like gold and whose flowers resembled a bright burning sun the sand that formed the soil of the garden was of a bright blue colour something like flames of sulphur and a strangely beautiful blue was spread over the whole so that one might have fancied oneself raised very high in the air with the sky at once above and below certainly not at the bottom of the sea when the waters were quite still the sun might be seen looking like a purple flower out of whose cup streamed forth the light of the world  each of the little princesses had her own plot in the garden where she might plant and sow at her pleasure one chose hers to be made in the shape of a whale another preferred the figure of a mermaid but the youngest had hers quite round    like the sun and planted in it only those flowers that were red as the sun seemed to her she was certainly a singular child very quiet and thoughtful whilst her sisters were adorning themselves with all sorts of gay things that came out of a ship which had been wrecked she asked for nothing but a beautiful white marble statue of a boy which had been found in it she put the statue in her garden and planted a red weeping willow by its side the tree grew up quickly and let its long boughs fall upon the bright blue ground where ever-moving shadows played in violet hues as if boughs and root were embracing  nothing pleased the little princess more than to hear about the world of human beings living above the sea she made her old grandmother tell her everything she knew about ships towns men and land animals and was particularly pleased when she heard that the flowers of the upper world had a pleasant fragrance for the flowers of the sea are scentless and that the woods were green and the fishes fluttering among the branches of various gay colours and that they could sing with a loud clear voice the old lady meant birds but she called them fishes because her grandchildren having never seen a bird would not otherwise have understood her   when you have attained your fifteenth year  added she  you will be permitted to rise to the surface of the sea you will then sit by moonlight in the clefts of the rocks see the ships sail by and learn to distinguish towns and men   the next year the eldest of the sisters reached this happy age but the others alas the second sister was a year younger than the eldest the third a year younger than the second and so on the youngest had still five whole years to wait till that joyful time should come when she also might rise to the surface of the water and see what was going on in the upper world however the eldest promised to tell the others of everything she might see when the first day of her being of age arrived for the grandmother gave them but little information and there was so much that they wished to hear  but none of all the sisters longed so ardently for the day when she should be released from childish restraint as the youngest she who had longest to wait and was so quiet and thoughtful many a night she stood by the open window looking up through the clear blue water whilst the fishes were leaping and playing around her she could see the sun and the moon their light was pale but they appeared larger than they do to those who live in the upper world if a shadow passed over them she knew it must be either a whale or a ship sailing by full of human beings who indeed little thought that far beneath them a little mermaid was passionately stretching forth her white hands towards their ship s keel  the day had now arrived when the eldest princess had attained her fifteenth year and was therefore allowed to rise up to the surface of the sea  when she returned she had a thousand things to relate her chief pleasure had been to sit upon a sandbank in the moonlight looking at the large town which lay on the coast where lights were beaming like stars and where music was playing she had heard the distant noise of men and carriages she had seen the high church-towers had listened to the ringing of the bells and just because she could not go there she longed the more after all these things  how attentively did her youngest sister listen to her words and when she next stood at night-time by her open window gazing upward through the blue waters she thought so intensely of the great noisy city that she fancied she could hear the church-bells ringing  next year the second sister received permission to swim wherever she pleased she rose to the surface of the sea just when the sun was setting and this sight so delighted her that she declared it to be more beautiful than anything else she had seen above the waters   the whole sky seemed tinged with gold  said she  and it is impossible for me to describe to you the beauty of the clouds now red now violet they glided over me but still more swiftly flew over the water a flock of white swans just where the sun was descending i looked after them but the sun disappeared and the bright rosy light on the surface of the sea and on the edges of the clouds was gradually extinguished   [illustration  she was on the whole a sensible sort of lady]  it was now time for the third sister to visit the upper world she was the boldest of the six and ventured up a river on its shores she saw green hills covered with woods and vineyards from among which arose houses and castles she heard the birds singing and the sun shone with so much power that she was continually obliged to plunge below in order to cool her burning face in a little bay she met with a number of children who were bathing and jumping about she would have joined in their gambols but the children fled back to land in great terror and a little black animal barked at her in such a manner that she herself was frightened at last and swam back to the sea she could not however forget the green woods the verdant hills and the pretty children who although they had no fins were swimming about in the river so fearlessly  the fourth sister was not so bold she remained in the open sea and said on her return home she thought nothing could be more beautiful she had seen ships sailing by so far off that they looked like sea-gulls she had watched the merry dolphins gambolling in the water and the enormous whales sending up into the air a thousand sparkling fountains  the year after the fifth sister attained her fifteenth year her birthday happened at a different season to that of her sisters it was winter the sea was of a green colour and immense icebergs were floating on its surface these she said looked like pearls they were however much larger than the church-towers in the land of human beings she sat down upon one of these pearls and let the wind play with her long hair but then all the ships hoisted their sails in terror and escaped as quickly as possible in the evening the sky was covered with sails and whilst the great mountains of ice alternately sank and rose again and beamed with a reddish glow flashes of lightning burst forth from the clouds and the thunder rolled on peal after peal the sails of all the ships were instantly furled and horror and affright reigned on board but the princess sat still on the iceberg looking unconcernedly at the blue zig-zag of the flashes  the first time that either of these sisters rose out of the sea she was quite enchanted at the sight of so many new and beautiful objects but the novelty was soon over and it was not long ere their own home appeared more attractive than the upper world for there only did they find everything agreeable  many an evening would the five sisters rise hand in hand from the depths of the ocean their voices were far sweeter than any human voice and when a storm was coming on they would swim in front of the ships and sing oh how sweetly did they sing describing the happiness of those who lived at the bottom of the sea and entreating the sailors not to be afraid but to come down to them  the mariners however did not understand their words they fancied the song was only the whistling of the wind and thus they lost the hidden glories of the sea for if their ships were wrecked all on board were drowned and none but dead men ever entered the mer-king s palace  whilst the sisters were swimming at evening-time the youngest would remain motionless and alone in her father s palace looking up after them she would have wept but mermaids cannot weep and therefore when they are troubled suffer infinitely more than human beings do   oh if i were but fifteen  sighed she  i know that i should love the upper world and its inhabitants so much   at last the time she had so longed for arrived   well now it is your turn  said the grandmother  come here that i may adorn you like your sisters  and she wound around her hair a wreath of white lilies whose every petal was the half of a pearl and then commanded eight large oysters to fasten themselves to the princess s tail in token of her high rank   but that is so very uncomfortable  said the little princess   one must not mind slight inconveniences when one wishes to look well  said the old lady  how willingly would the princess have given up all this splendour and exchanged her heavy crown for the red flowers of her garden which were so much more becoming to her but she dared not do so  farewell  said she and she rose from the sea light as a flake of foam  [illustration  the youngest was the most lovely]  when for the first time in her life she appeared on the surface of the water the sun had just sunk below the horizon the clouds were beaming with bright golden and rosy hues the evening star was shining in the pale western sky the air was mild and refreshing and the sea as smooth as a looking-glass a large ship with three masts lay on the still waters one sail only was unfurled but not a breath was stirring and the sailors were quietly seated on the cordage and ladders of the vessel music and song resounded from the deck and after it grew dark hundreds of lamps all on a sudden burst forth into light whilst innumerable flags were fluttering overhead the little mermaid swam close up to the captain s cabin and every now and then when the ship was raised by the motion of the water she could look through the clear window panes she saw within many richly dressed men the handsomest among them was a young prince with large black eyes he could not certainly be more than sixteen years old and it was in honour of his birthday that a grand festival was being celebrated the crew were dancing on the deck and when the young prince appeared among them a hundred rockets were sent up into the air turning night into day and so terrifying the little mermaid that for some minutes she plunged beneath the water however she soon raised her little head again and then it seemed as if all the stars were falling down upon her such a fiery shower she had never even seen before never had she heard that men possessed such wonderful powers large suns revolved around her bright fishes swam in the air and everything was reflected perfectly on the clear surface of the sea it was so light in the ship that everything could be seen distinctly oh how happy the young prince was he shook hands with the sailors laughed and jested with them whilst sweet notes of music mingled with the silence of night  it was now late but the little mermaid could not tear herself away from the ship and the handsome young prince she remained looking through the cabin window rocked to and fro by the waves there was a foaming and fermentation in the depths beneath and the ship began to move on faster the sails were spread the waves rose high thick clouds gathered over the sky and the noise of distant thunder was heard the sailors perceived that a storm was coming on so they again furled the sails the great vessel was tossed about on the tempestuous ocean like a light boat and the waves rose to an immense height towering over the ship which alternately sank beneath and rose above them to the little mermaid this seemed most delightful but the ship s crew thought very differently the vessel cracked the stout masts bent under the violence of the billows the waters rushed in for a minute the ship tottered to and fro then the main-mast broke as if it had been a reed the ship turned over and was filled with water the little mermaid now perceived that the crew was in danger for she herself was forced to beware of the beams and splinters torn from the vessel and floating about on the waves but at the same time it became pitch dark so that she could not distinguish anything presently however a dreadful flash of lightning disclosed to her the whole of the wreck her eyes sought the young prince the same instant the ship sank to the bottom at first she was delighted thinking that the prince must now come to her abode but she soon remembered that man cannot live in water and that therefore if the prince ever entered her palace it would be as a corpse   die no he must not die  she swam through the fragments with which the water was strewn regardless of the danger she was incurring and at last found the prince all but exhausted and with great difficulty keeping his head above water he had already closed his eyes and must inevitably have been drowned had not the little mermaid come to his rescue she seized hold of him and kept him above water suffering the current to bear them on together  towards morning the storm was hushed no trace however remained of the ship the sun rose like fire out of the sea his beams seemed to restore colour to the prince s cheeks but his eyes were still closed the mermaid kissed his high forehead and stroked his wet hair away from his face he looked like the marble statue in her garden she kissed him again and wished most fervently that he might recover  she now saw the dry land with its mountains glittering with snow a green wood extended along the coast and at the entrance of the wood stood a chapel or convent she could not be sure which citron and lemon trees grew in the garden adjoining it an avenue of tall palm trees led up to the door the sea here formed a little bay in which the water was quite smooth but very deep and under the cliffs there were dry firm sands hither swam the little mermaid with the seemingly dead prince she laid him upon the warm sand and took care to place his head high and to turn his face to the sun  the bells began to ring in the large white building which stood before her and a number of young girls came out to walk in the garden the mermaid went away from the shore hid herself behind some stones covered her head with foam so that her little face could not be seen and watched the prince with unremitting attention  it was not long before one of the young girls approached she seemed quite frightened at finding the prince in this state apparently dead soon however she recovered herself and ran back to call her sisters the little mermaid saw that the prince revived and that all around smiled kindly and joyfully upon him for her however he looked not he knew not that it was she who had saved him and when the prince was taken into the house she felt so sad that she immediately plunged beneath the water and returned to her father s palace  if she had been before quiet and thoughtful she now grew still more so her sisters asked her what she had seen in the upper world but she made no answer  many an evening she rose to the place where she had left the prince she saw the snow on the mountains melt the fruits in the garden ripen and gathered but the prince she never saw so she always returned sorrowfully to her subterranean abode her only pleasure was to sit in her little garden gazing on the beautiful statue so like the prince she cared no longer for her flowers they grew up in wild luxuriance covered the steps and entwined their long stems and tendrils among the boughs of the trees so that her whole garden became a bower  at last being unable to conceal her sorrow any longer she revealed the secret to one of her sisters who told it to the other princesses and they to some of their friends among them was a young mermaid who recollected the prince having been an eye-witness herself to the festivities in the ship she knew also in what country the prince lived and the name of its king   come little sister  said the princesses and embracing her they rose together arm in arm out of the water just in front of the prince s palace  this palace was built of bright yellow stones a flight of white marble steps led from it down to the sea a gilded cupola crowned the building and white marble figures which might almost have been taken for real men and women were placed among the pillars surrounding it through the clear glass of the high windows one might look into magnificent apartments hung with silken curtains the walls adorned with magnificent paintings it was a real treat to the little royal mermaids to behold so splendid an abode they gazed through the windows of one of the largest rooms and in the centre saw a fountain playing whose waters sprang up so high as to reach the glittering cupola above through which the sunbeams fell dancing on the water and brightening the pretty plants which grew around it  the little mermaid now knew where her beloved prince dwelt and henceforth she went there almost every evening she often approached nearer the land than her sisters had ventured and even swam up the narrow channel that flowed under the marble balcony here on a bright moonlight night she would watch the young prince who believed himself alone  sometimes she saw him sailing on the water in a gaily painted boat with many coloured flags waving above she would then hide among the green reeds which grew on the banks listening to his voice and if any one in the boat noticed the rustling of her long silver veil which was caught now and then by the light breeze they only fancied it was a swan flapping his wings  many a night when the fishermen were casting their nets by the beacon s light she heard them talking of the prince and relating the noble actions he had performed she was then so happy thinking how she had saved his life when struggling with the waves and remembering how his head had rested on her bosom and how she had kissed him when he knew nothing of it and could never even dream of such a thing  human beings became more and more dear to her every day she wished that she were one of them their world seemed to her much larger than that of the mer-people they could fly over the ocean in their ships as well as climb to the summits of those high mountains that rose above the clouds and their wooded domains extended much farther than a mermaid s eye could penetrate  there were many things that she wished to hear explained but her sisters could not give her any satisfactory answer she was again obliged to have recourse to the old queen-mother who knew a great deal about the upper world which she used to call  the country above the sea    do men when they are not drowned live for ever  she asked one day  do they not die as we do who live at the bottom of the sea    yes  was the grandmother s reply  they must die like us and their life is much shorter than ours we live to the age of three hundred years but when we die we become foam on the sea and are not allowed even to share a grave among those that are dear to us we have no immortal souls we can never live again and are like the grass which when once cut down is withered for ever human beings on the contrary have souls that continue to live when their bodies become dust and as we rise out of the water to admire the abode of man they ascend to glorious unknown dwellings in the skies which we are not permitted to see    why have not we immortal souls  asked the little mermaid  i would willingly give up my three hundred years to be a human being for only one day thus to become entitled to that heavenly world above    you must not think of that  answered her grandmother  it is much better as it is we live longer and are far happier than human beings    so i must die and be dashed like foam over the sea never to rise again and hear the gentle murmur of the ocean never again see the beautiful flowers and the bright sun tell me dear grandmother are there no means by which i may obtain an immortal soul    no  replied the old lady  it is true that if thou couldst so win the affections of a human being as to become dearer to him than either father or mother if he loved thee with all his heart and promised whilst the priest joined his hands with thine to be always faithful to thee then his soul would flow into thine and thou wouldst then become partaker of human bliss but that can never be for what in our eyes is the most beautiful part of our body the tail the inhabitants of the earth think hideous they cannot bear it to appear handsome to them the body must have two clumsy props which they call legs   the little mermaid sighed and looked mournfully at the scaly part of her form otherwise so fair and delicate   we are happy  added the old lady  we shall jump and swim about merrily for three hundred years that is a long time and afterwards we shall repose peacefully in death this evening we have a court ball   the ball which the queen-mother spoke of was far more splendid than any that earth has ever seen the walls of the saloon were of crystal very thick but yet very clear hundreds of large mussel-shells were planted in rows along them these shells were some of rose-colour some green as grass but all sending forth a bright light which not only illuminated the whole apartment but also shone through the glassy walls so as to light up the waters around for a great space and making the scales of the numberless fishes great and small crimson and purple silver and gold-coloured appear more brilliant than ever  through the centre of the saloon flowed a bright clear stream on the surface of which danced mermen and mermaids to the melody of their own sweet voices voices far sweeter than those of the dwellers upon earth the little princess sang more harmoniously than any other and they clapped their hands and applauded her she was pleased at this for she knew well that there was neither on earth or in the sea a more beautiful voice than hers but her thoughts soon returned to the world above her  she could not forget the handsome prince she could not control her sorrow at not having an immortal soul she stole away from her father s palace and whilst all was joy within she sat alone lost in thought in her little neglected garden on a sudden she heard the tones of horns resounding over the water far away in the distance and she said to herself  now he is going out to hunt he whom i love more than my father and my mother with whom my thoughts are constantly occupied and to whom i would so willingly trust the happiness of my life all all will i risk to win him and an immortal soul whilst my sisters are still dancing in the palace i will go to the enchantress whom i have hitherto feared so much but who is nevertheless the only person who can advise and help me   [illustration  they ate from their hands]  so the little mermaid left the garden and went to the foaming whirlpool beyond which dwelt the enchantress she had never been this way before neither flowers nor sea-grass bloomed along her path she had to traverse an extent of bare grey sand till she reached the whirlpool whose waters were eddying and whizzing like mill-wheels tearing everything they could seize along with them into the abyss below she was obliged to make her way through this horrible place in order to arrive at the territory of the enchantress then she had to pass through a boiling slimy bog which the enchantress called her turf-moor  her house stood in a wood beyond this and a strange abode it was all the trees and bushes around were polypi looking like hundred-headed serpents shooting up out of the ground their branches were long slimy arms with fingers of worms every member from the root to the uttermost tip ceaselessly moving and extending on all sides whatever they seized they fastened upon so that it could not loosen itself from their grasp the little mermaid stood still for a minute looking at this horrible wood her heart beat with fear and she would certainly have returned without attaining her object had she not remembered the prince and immortality the thought gave her new courage she bound up her long waving hair that the polypi might not catch hold of it crossed her delicate arms over her bosom and swifter than a fish can glide through the water she passed these unseemly trees who stretched their eager arms after her in vain she could not however help seeing that every polypus had something in his grasp held as firmly by a thousand little arms as if enclosed by iron bands the whitened skeletons of a number of human beings who had been drowned in the sea and had sunk into the abyss grinned horribly from the arms of these polypi helms chests skeletons of land animals were also held in their embrace among other things might be seen even a little mermaid whom they had seized and strangled what a fearful sight for the unfortunate princess  but she got safely through this wood of horrors and then arrived at a slimy place where immense fat snails were crawling about and in the midst of this place stood a house built of the bones of unfortunate people who had been shipwrecked here sat the witch caressing a toad in the same manner as some persons would a pet bird the ugly fat snails she called her chickens and she permitted them to crawl about her   i know well what you would ask of me  said she to the little princess  your wish is foolish enough yet it shall be fulfilled though its accomplishment is sure to bring misfortune on you my fairest princess you wish to get rid of your tail and to have instead two stilts like those of human beings in order that a young prince may fall in love with you and that you may obtain an immortal soul is it not so  whilst the witch spoke these words she laughed so violently that her pet toad and snails fell from her lap  you come just at the right time  continued she  had you come after sunset it would not have been in my power to have helped you before another year i will prepare for you a drink with which you must swim to land you must sit down upon the shore and swallow it and then your tail will fall and shrink up to the things which men call legs this transformation will however be very painful you will feel as though a sharp knife passed through your body all who look on you after you have been thus changed will say that you are the loveliest child of earth they have ever seen you will retain your peculiar undulating movements and no dancer will move so lightly but every step you take will cause you pain all but unbearable it will seem to you as though you were walking on the sharp edges of swords and your blood will flow can you endure all this suffering if so i will grant your request    yes i will  answered the princess with a faltering voice for she remembered her dear prince and the immortal soul which her suffering might win   only consider  said the witch  that you can never again become a mermaid when once you have received a human form you may never return to your sisters and your father s palace and unless you shall win the prince s love to such a degree that he shall leave father and mother for you that you shall be mixed up with all his thoughts and wishes and unless the priest join your hands so that you become man and wife you will never obtain the immortality you seek the morrow of the day on which he is united to another will see your death your heart will break with sorrow and you will be changed to foam on the sea    still i will venture  said the little mermaid pale and trembling as a dying person   besides all this i must be paid and it is no slight thing that i require for my trouble thou hast the sweetest voice of all the dwellers in the sea and thou thinkest by its means to charm the prince this voice however i demand as my recompense the best thing thou possessest i require in exchange for my magic drink for i shall be obliged to sacrifice my own blood in order to give it the sharpness of a two-edged sword    but if you take my voice from me  said the princess  what have i left with which to charm the prince    thy graceful form  replied the witch  thy modest gait and speaking eyes with such as these it will be easy to infatuate a vain human heart well now hast thou lost courage put out thy little tongue that i may cut it off and take it for myself in return for my magic drink    be it so  said the princess and the witch took up her caldron in order to mix her potion  cleanliness is a good thing  remarked she as she began to rub the caldron with a handful of toads and snails she then scratched her bosom and let the black blood trickle down into the caldron every moment throwing in new ingredients the smoke from the mixture assuming such horrible forms as were enough to fill beholders with terror and a moaning and groaning proceeding from it which might be compared to the weeping of crocodiles the magic drink at length became clear and transparent as pure water it was ready   here it is  said the witch to the princess cutting out her tongue at the same moment the poor little mermaid was now dumb  she could neither sing nor speak   if the polypi should attempt to seize you as you pass through my little grove  said the witch  you have only to sprinkle some of this magic drink over them and their arms will burst into a thousand pieces  but the princess had no need of this counsel for the polypi drew hastily back as soon as they perceived the bright phial that glittered in her hand like a star thus she passed safely through the formidable wood over the moor and across the foaming mill-stream  she now looked once again at her father s palace the lamps in the saloon were extinguished and all the family were asleep she would not go in for she could not speak if she did she was about to leave her home for ever her heart was ready to break with sorrow at the thought she stole into the garden plucked a flower from the bed of each of her sisters as a remembrance kissed her hand again and again and then rose through the dark blue waters to the world above  the sun had not yet risen when she arrived at the prince s dwelling and ascended those well-known marble steps the moon still shone in the sky when the little mermaid drank off the wonderful liquid contained in her phial she felt it run through her like a sharp knife and she fell down in a swoon when the sun rose she awoke and felt a burning pain in all her limbs but she saw standing close to her the object of her love the handsome young prince whose coal-black eyes were fixed inquiringly upon her full of shame she cast down her own and perceived instead of the long fish-like tail she had hitherto borne two slender legs but she was quite naked and tried in vain to cover herself with her long thick hair the prince asked who she was and how she had got there and she in reply smiled and gazed upon him with her bright blue eyes for alas she could not speak he then led her by the hand into the palace she found that the witch had told her true she felt as though she were walking on the edges of sharp swords but she bore the pain willingly on she passed light as a zephyr and all who saw her wondered at her light undulating movements  when she entered the palace rich clothes of muslin and silk were brought to her she was lovelier than all who dwelt there but she could neither speak nor sing some female slaves gaily dressed in silk and gold brocade sang before the prince and his royal parents and one of them distinguished herself by her clear sweet voice which the prince applauded by clapping his hands this made the little mermaid very sad for she knew that she used to sing far better than the young slave  alas  thought she  if he did but know that for his sake i have given away my voice for ever   the slaves began to dance our lovely little mermaiden then arose stretched out her delicate white arms and hovered gracefully about the room every motion displayed more and more the perfect symmetry and elegance of her figure and the expression which beamed in her speaking eyes touched the hearts of the spectators far more than the song of the slaves  all present were enchanted but especially the young prince who called her his dear little foundling and she danced again and again although every step cost her excessive pain the prince then said she should always be with him and accordingly a sleeping-place was prepared for her on velvet cushions in the anteroom of his own apartment  the prince caused a suit of male apparel to be made for her in order that she might accompany him in his rides so together they traversed the fragrant woods where green boughs brushed against their shoulders and the birds sang merrily among the fresh leaves with him she climbed up steep mountains and although her tender feet bled so as to be remarked by the attendants she only smiled and followed her dear prince to the heights whence they could see the clouds chasing each other beneath them like a flock of birds migrating to other countries  during the night she would when all in the palace were at rest walk down the marble steps in order to cool her feet in the deep waters she would then think of those beloved ones who dwelt in the lower world  one night as she was thus bathing her feet her sisters swam together to the spot arm in arm and singing but alas so mournfully she beckoned to them and they immediately recognised her and told her how great was the mourning in her father s house for her loss from this time the sisters visited her every night and once they brought with them the old grandmother who had not seen the upper world for a great many years they likewise brought their father the mer-king with his crown on his head but these two old people did not venture near enough to land to be able to speak to her  the little mermaiden became dearer and dearer to the prince every day but he only looked upon her as a sweet gentle child and the thought of making her his wife never entered his head and yet his wife she must be ere she could receive an immortal soul his wife she must be or she would change into foam and be driven restlessly over the billows of the sea   dost thou not love me above all others  her eyes seemed to ask as he pressed her fondly in his arms and kissed her lovely brow  [illustration  many an evening she rose to the place]   yes  the prince would say  thou art dearer to me than any other for no one is as good as thou art thou lovest me so much and thou art so like a young maiden whom i have seen but once and may never see again i was on board a ship which was wrecked by a sudden tempest the waves threw me on the shore near a holy temple where a number of young girls are occupied constantly with religious services the youngest of them found me on the shore and saved my life i saw her only once but her image is vividly impressed upon my memory and her alone can i love but she belongs to the holy temple and thou who resemblest her so much hast been given to me for consolation never will we be parted    alas he does not know that it was i who saved his life  thought the little mermaiden sighing deeply  i bore him over the wild waves into the wooded bay where the holy temple stood i sat behind the rocks waiting till some one should come i saw the pretty maiden approach whom he loves more than me  and again she heaved a deep sigh for she could not weep  he said that the young girl belongs to the holy temple she never comes out into the world so they cannot meet each other again and i am always with him see him daily i will love him and devote my whole life to him    so the prince is going to be married to the beautiful daughter of the neighbouring king  said the courtiers  that is why he is having that splendid ship fitted out it is announced that he wishes to travel but in reality he goes to see the princess a numerous retinue will accompany him  the little mermaiden smiled at these and similar conjectures for she knew the prince s intentions better than any one else   i must go  he said to her  i must see the beautiful princess my parents require me to do so but they will not compel me to marry her and bring her home as my bride and it is quite impossible for me to love her for she cannot be so like the beautiful girl in the temple as thou art and if i were obliged to choose i should prefer thee my little silent foundling with the speaking eyes  and he kissed her rosy lips played with her locks and folded her in his arms whereupon arose in her heart a sweet vision of human happiness and immortal bliss   thou art not afraid of the sea art thou my sweet silent child  asked he tenderly as they stood together in the splendid ship which was to take them to the country of the neighbouring king and then he told her of the storms that sometimes agitate the waters of the strange fishes that inhabit the deep and of the wonderful things seen by divers but she smiled at his words for she knew better than any child of earth what went on in the depths of the ocean  at night-time when the moon shone brightly and when all on board were fast asleep she sat in the ship s gallery looking down into the sea it seemed to her as she gazed through the foamy track made by the ship s keel that she saw her father s palace and her grandmother s silver crown she then saw her sisters rise out of the water looking sorrowful and stretching out their hands towards her she nodded to them smiled and would have explained that everything was going on quite according to her wishes but just then the cabin boy approached upon which the sisters plunged beneath the water so suddenly that the boy thought what he had seen on the waves was nothing but foam  the next morning the ship entered the harbour of the king s splendid capital bells were rung trumpets sounded and soldiers marched in procession through the city with waving banners and glittering bayonets every day witnessed some new entertainments balls and parties followed each other the princess however was not yet in the town she had been sent to a distant convent for education and had there been taught the practice of all royal virtues at last she arrived at the palace  the little mermaid had been anxious to see this unparalleled princess and she was now obliged to confess that she had never before seen so beautiful a creature  the skin of the princess was so white and delicate that the veins might be seen through it and her dark eyes sparkled beneath a pair of finely formed eye-brows   it is herself  exclaimed the prince when they met  it is she who saved my life when i lay like a corpse on the sea-shore  and he pressed his blushing bride to his beating heart   oh i am all too happy  said he to his dumb foundling  what i never dared to hope for has come to pass thou must rejoice in my happiness for thou lovest me more than all others who surround me  and the little mermaid kissed his hand in silent sorrow it seemed to her as if her heart was breaking already although the morrow of his marriage-day which must inevitably see her death had not yet dawned  again rung the church-bells whilst heralds rode through the streets of the capital to announce the approaching bridal odorous flames burned in silver candlesticks on all the altars the priests swung their golden censers and bride and bridegroom joined hands whilst the holy words that united them were spoken the little mermaid clad in silk and cloth of gold stood behind the princess and held the train of the bridal dress but her ear heard nothing of the solemn music her eye saw not the holy ceremony she remembered her approaching end she remembered that she had lost both this world and the next  that very same evening bride and bridegroom went on board the ship cannons were fired flags waved with the breeze and in the centre of the deck stood a magnificent pavilion of purple and cloth of gold fitted up with the richest and softest couches here the princely pair were to spend the night a favourable wind swelled the sails and the ship glided lightly over the blue waters  as soon as it was dark coloured lamps were hung out and dancing began on the deck the little mermaid was thus involuntarily reminded of what she had seen the first time she rose to the upper world the spectacle that now presented itself was equally splendid and she was obliged to join in the  [illustration  when the sun arose she awoke]  dance hovering lightly as a bird over the ship boards all applauded her for never had she danced with more enchanting grace her little feet suffered extremely but she no longer felt the pain the anguish her heart suffered was much greater it was the last evening she might see him for whose sake she had forsaken her home and all her family had given away her beautiful voice and suffered daily the most violent pain all without his having the least suspicion of it it was the last evening that she might breathe the same atmosphere in which he the beloved one lived the last evening when she might behold the deep blue sea and the starry heavens an eternal night in which she might neither think nor dream awaited her and all was joy in the ship and she her heart filled with thoughts of death and annihilation smiled and danced with the others till past midnight then the prince kissed his lovely bride and arm in arm they entered the magnificent tent prepared for their repose  all was now still the steersman alone stood at the ship s helm the little mermaid leaned her white arms on the gallery and looked towards the east watching for the dawn she well knew that the first sunbeam would witness her dissolution she saw her sisters rise out of the sea deadly pale were their features and their long hair no more fluttered over their shoulders it had all been cut off   we have given it to the witch  said they  to induce her to help thee so that thou mayest not die she has given to us a penknife  here it is before the sun rises thou must plunge it into the prince s heart and when his warm blood trickles down upon thy feet they will again be changed to a fish-like tail thou wilt once more become a mermaid and wilt live thy full three hundred years ere thou changest to foam on the sea but hasten either he or thou must die before sunrise our aged mother mourns for thee so much her grey hair has fallen off through sorrow as ours fell before the scissors of the witch kill the prince and come down to us hasten hasten dost thou not see the red streaks on the eastern sky announcing the near approach of the sun a few minutes more and he rises and then all will be over with thee  at these words they sighed deeply and vanished  the little mermaid drew aside the purple curtains of the pavilion where lay the bride and bridegroom bending over them she kissed the prince s forehead and then glancing at the sky she saw that the dawning light became every moment brighter the prince s lips unconsciously murmured the name of his bride he was dreaming of her and her only whilst the fatal penknife trembled in the hand of the unhappy mermaid all at once she threw far out into the sea that instrument of death the waves rose like bright blazing flames around and the water where it fell seemed tinged with blood with eyes fast becoming dim and fixed she looked once more at her beloved prince then plunged from the ship into the sea and felt her body slowly but surely dissolving into foam  the sun rose from his watery bed his beams fell so softly and warmly upon her that our little mermaid was scarcely sensible of dying she still saw the glorious sun and over her head hovered a thousand beautiful transparent forms she could still distinguish the white sails of the ship and the bright red clouds in the sky the voices of those airy creatures above her had a melody so sweet and soothing that a human ear would be as little able to catch the sound as her eye was capable of distinguishing their forms they hovered around her without wings borne by their own lightness through the air the little mermaid at last saw that she had a body as transparent as theirs and felt herself raised gradually from the foam of the sea to higher regions   where are they taking me  asked she and her words sounded just like the voices of those heavenly beings   speak you to the daughters of air  was the answer  the mermaid has no immortal soul and can only acquire that heavenly gift by winning the love of one of the sons of men her immortality depends upon union with man neither do the daughters of air possess immortal souls but they can acquire them by their own good deeds we fly to hot countries where the children of earth are sinking under sultry pestilential breezes our fresh cooling breath revives them we diffuse ourselves through the atmosphere we perfume it with the delicious fragrance of flowers and thus spread delight and health over the earth by doing good in this manner for three hundred years we win immortality and receive a share of the eternal bliss of human beings and thou poor little mermaid who following the impulse of thine own heart hast done and suffered so much thou art now raised to the airy world of spirits that by performing deeds of kindness for three hundred years thou mayest acquire an immortal soul   the little mermaid stretched out her transparent arms to the sun and for the first time in her life tears moistened her eyes  and now again all were awake and rejoicing in the ship she saw the prince with his pretty bride they had missed her they looked sorrowfully down on the foamy waters as if they knew she had plunged into the sea unseen she kissed the bridegroom s forehead smiled upon him and then with the rest of the children of air soared high above the rosy cloud which was sailing so peacefully over the ship     after three hundred years we shall fly in the kingdom of heaven    we may arrive there even sooner  whispered one of her sisters  we fly invisibly through the dwellings of men where there are children and whenever we find a good child who gives pleasure to his parents and deserves their love the good god shortens our time of probation no child is aware that we are flitting about his room and that whenever joy draws from us a smile a year is struck out of our three hundred but when we see a rude naughty child we weep bitter tears of sorrow and every tear we shed adds a day to our time of probation"@"the little mermaid"@"hans christian andersen"
"it was beautiful in the country it was summer-time the wheat was yellow the oats were green the hay was stacked up in the green meadows and the stork paraded about on his long red legs discoursing in egyptian which language he had learned from his mother the fields and meadows were skirted by thick woods and a deep lake lay in the midst of the woods yes it was indeed beautiful in the country the sunshine fell warmly on an old mansion surrounded by deep canals and from the walls down to the water s edge there grew large burdock-leaves so high that children could stand upright among them without being perceived this place was as wild and unfrequented as the thickest part of the wood and on that account a duck had chosen to make her nest there she was sitting on her eggs but the pleasure she had felt at first was now almost gone because she had been there so long and had so few visitors for the other ducks preferred swimming on the canals to sitting among the burdock-leaves gossiping with her  at last the eggs cracked one after another  tchick tchick  all the eggs were alive and one little head after another appeared  quack quack  said the duck and all got up as well as they could they peeped about from under the green leaves and as green is good for the eyes their mother let them look as long as they pleased   how large the world is  said the little ones for they found their present situation very different to their former confined one while yet in the egg-shells   do you imagine this to be the whole of the world  said the mother  it extends far beyond the other side of the garden to the pastor s field but i have never been there are you all here  and then she got up  no i have not got you all the largest egg is still here how long will this last i am so weary of it  and then she sat down again   well and how are you getting on  asked an old duck who had come to pay her a visit   this one egg keeps me so long  said the mother  it will not break but you should see the others they are the prettiest little ducklings i have seen in all my days they are all like their father the good-for-nothing fellow he has not been to visit me once    let me see the egg that will not break  said the old duck  depend upon it it is a turkey s egg i was cheated in the same way once myself and i had such trouble with the young ones for they were afraid of the water and i could not get them there i called and scolded but it was all of no use but let me see the egg ah yes to be sure that is a turkey s egg leave it and teach the other little ones to swim    i will sit on it a little longer  said the duck  i have been sitting so long that i may as well spend the harvest here    it is no business of mine  said the old duck and away she waddled  the great egg burst at last  tchick tchick  said the little one and out it tumbled but oh how large and ugly it was the duck looked at it  that is a great strong creature  said she  none of the others are at all like it can it be a young turkey-cock well we shall soon find out it must go into the water though i push it in myself  the next day there was delightful weather and the sun shone warmly upon all the green leaves when mother-duck with all her family went down to the canal plump she went into the water  quack quack  cried she and one duckling after another jumped in the water closed over their heads but all came up again and swam together in the pleasantest manner their legs moved without effort all were there even the ugly grey one   no it is not a turkey  said the old duck  only see how prettily it moves its legs how upright it holds itself it is my own child it is also really very pretty when one looks more closely at it quack quack now come with me i will take you into the world introduce you in the duck-yard but keep close to me or some one may tread on you and beware of the cat   so they came into the duck-yard there was a horrid noise two families were quarrelling about the remains of an eel which in the end was secured by the cat   see my children such is the way of the world  said the mother-duck wiping her beak for she too was fond of roasted eels  now use your legs  said she  keep together and bow to the old duck you see yonder she is the most distinguished of all the fowls present and is of spanish blood which accounts for her dignified appearance and manners and look she has a red rag on her leg that is considered extremely handsome and is the greatest distinction a duck can have don t turn your feet inwards a well-educated duckling always keeps his legs far apart like his father and mother just so look now bow your necks and say quack   and they did as they were told but the other ducks who were in the yard looked at them and said aloud  only see now we have another brood as if there were not enough of us already and fie how ugly that one is we will not endure it  and immediately one of the ducks flew at him and bit him in the neck   leave him alone  said the mother  he is doing no one any harm    yes but he is so large and so strange-looking and therefore he shall be teased    those are fine children that our good mother has  said the old duck with the red rag on her leg  all are pretty except one and that has not turned out well i almost wish it could be hatched over again    that cannot be please your highness  said the mother  certainly he is not handsome but he is a very good child and swims as well as the others indeed rather better i think he will grow like the others all in good time and perhaps will look smaller he stayed so long in the egg-shell that is the cause of the difference  and she scratched the duckling s neck and stroked his whole body  besides  added she  he is a drake i think he will be very strong therefore it does not matter so much he will fight his way through    the other ducks are very pretty  said the old duck  pray make yourselves at home and if you find an eel s head you can bring it to me   and accordingly they made themselves at home  but the poor little duckling who had come last out of its egg-shell and who was so ugly was bitten pecked and teased by both ducks and hens  it is so large  said they all and the turkey-cock who had come into the world with spurs on and therefore fancied he was an emperor puffed himself up like a ship in full sail and marched up to the duckling quite red with passion the poor little thing scarcely knew what to do he was quite distressed because he was so ugly and because he was the jest of the poultry-yard  [illustration  he came to a wide moor]  so passed the first day and afterwards matters grew worse and worse the poor duckling was scorned by all even his brothers and sisters behaved unkindly and were constantly saying  the cat fetch thee thou nasty creature  the mother said  ah if thou wert only far away  the ducks bit him the hens pecked him and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him he ran over the hedge the little birds in the bushes were terrified  that is because i am so ugly  thought the duckling shutting his eyes but he ran on at last he came to a wide moor where lived some wild ducks here he lay the whole night so tired and so comfortless in the morning the wild ducks flew up and perceived their new companion  pray who are you  asked they and our little duckling turned himself in all directions and greeted them as politely as possible   you are really uncommonly ugly  said the wild ducks  however that does not matter to us provided you do not marry into our families  poor thing he had never thought of marrying he only begged permission to lie among the reeds and drink the water of the moor  there he lay for two whole days on the third day there came two wild geese or rather ganders who had not been long out of their egg-shells which accounts for their impertinence   hark ye  said they  you are so ugly that we like you infinitely well will you come with us and be a bird of passage on another moor not far from this are some dear sweet wild geese as lovely creatures as have ever said hiss hiss you are truly in the way to make your fortune ugly as you are   bang a gun went off all at once and both wild geese were stretched dead among the reeds the water became red with blood bang a gun went off again whole flocks of wild geese flew up from among the reeds and another report followed  there was a grand hunting party  the hunters lay in ambush all around some were even sitting in the trees whose huge branches stretched far over the moor the blue smoke rose through the thick trees like a mist and was dispersed as it fell over the water the hounds splashed about in the mud the reeds and rushes bent in all directions how frightened the poor little duck was he turned his head thinking to hide it under his wings and in a moment a most formidable-looking dog stood close to him his tongue hanging out of his mouth his eyes sparkling fearfully he opened wide his jaws at the sight of our duckling showed him his sharp white teeth and splash splash he was gone gone without hurting him   well let me be thankful  sighed he  i am so ugly that even the dog will not eat me   and now he lay still though the shooting continued among the reeds shot following shot  the noise did not cease till late in the day and even then the poor little thing dared not stir he waited several hours before he looked around him and then hastened away from the moor as fast as he could he ran over fields and meadows though the wind was so high that he had some difficulty in proceeding  towards evening he reached a wretched little hut so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing the wind blew violently so that our poor little duckling was obliged to support himself on his tail in order to stand against it but it became worse and worse he then remarked that the door had lost one of its hinges and hung so much awry that he could creep through the crevice into the room which he did  in this room lived an old woman with her tom-cat and her hen and the cat whom she called her little son knew how to set up his back and purr indeed he could even emit sparks when stroked the wrong way the hen had very short legs and was therefore called  cuckoo shortlegs  she laid very good eggs and the old woman loved her as her own child  the next morning the new guest was perceived the cat began to mew and the hen to cackle   what is the matter  asked the old woman looking round however her eyes were not good so she took the young duckling to be a fat duck who had lost her way  this is a capital catch  said she  i shall now have duck s eggs if it be not a drake  we must try   and so the duckling was put to the proof for three weeks but no eggs made their appearance  now the cat was the master of the house and the hen was the mistress and they used always to say  we and the world  for they imagined themselves to be not only the half of the world but also by far the better half the duckling thought it was possible to be of a different opinion but that the hen would not allow   can you lay eggs  asked she   no    well then hold your tongue   and the cat said  can you set up your back can you purr    no    well then you should have no opinion when reasonable persons are speaking   so the duckling sat alone in a corner and was in a very bad humour however he happened to think of the fresh air and bright sunshine and these thoughts gave him such a strong desire to swim again that he could not help telling it to the hen   what ails you  said the hen  you have nothing to do and therefore brood over these fancies either lay eggs or purr then you will forget them    but it is so delicious to swim  said the duckling  so delicious when the waters close over your head and you plunge to the bottom    well that is a queer sort of a pleasure  said the hen  i think you must be crazy not to speak of myself ask the cat he is the most sensible animal i know whether he would like to swim or to plunge to the bottom of the water ask our mistress the old woman there is no one in the world wiser than she do you think she would take pleasure in swimming and in the waters closing over her head    you do not understand me  said the duckling   what we do not understand you so you think yourself wiser than the cat and the old woman not to speak of myself do not fancy any such thing child but be thankful for all the kindness that has been shown you are you not lodged in a warm room and have you not the advantage of society from which you can learn something but you are a simpleton and it is wearisome to have anything to do with you believe me i wish you well i tell you unpleasant truths but it is thus that real friendship is shown come for once give yourself the trouble to learn to purr or to lay eggs    i think i will go out into the wide world again  said the duckling   well go  answered the hen  so the duckling went he swam on the surface of the water he plunged beneath but all animals passed him by on account of his ugliness and the autumn came the leaves turned yellow and brown the wind caught them and danced them about the air was very cold the clouds were heavy with hail or snow and the raven sat on the hedge and croaked  the poor duckling was certainly not very comfortable  one evening just as the sun was setting with unusual brilliancy a flock of large beautiful birds rose from out of the brushwood the duckling had never seen anything so beautiful before their plumage was of a dazzling white and they had long slender necks they were swans they uttered a singular cry spread out their long splendid wings and flew away from these cold regions to warmer countries across the open sea they flew so high so very high and the little ugly duckling s feelings were so strange he turned round and round in the water like a mill-wheel strained his neck to look after them and sent forth such a loud and strange cry that it almost frightened himself ah he could not forget them those noble  [illustration  and the cat said  can you purr ]  birds those happy birds when he could see them no longer he plunged to the bottom of the water and when he rose again was almost beside himself the duckling knew not what the birds were called knew not whither they were flying yet he loved them as he had never before loved anything he envied them not it would never have occurred to him to wish such beauty for himself he would have been quite contented if the duck in the duck-yard had but endured his company the poor ugly animal  and the winter was so cold so cold the duckling was obliged to swim round and round in the water to keep it from freezing but every night the opening in which he swam became smaller and smaller it froze so that the crust of ice crackled the duckling was obliged to make good use of his legs to prevent the water from freezing entirely at last wearied out he lay stiff and cold in the ice  early in the morning there passed by a peasant who saw him broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe and brought him home to his wife  he now revived the children would have played with him but our duckling thought they wished to tease him and in his terror jumped into the milk-pail so that the milk was spilled about the room  the good woman screamed and clapped her hands he flew thence into the pan where the butter was kept and thence into the meal-barrel and out again and then how strange he looked  the woman screamed and struck at him with the tongs the children ran races with each other trying to catch him and laughed and screamed likewise it was well for him that the door stood open he jumped out among the bushes into the new-fallen snow he lay there as in a dream  but it would be too melancholy to relate all the trouble and misery that he was obliged to suffer during the severity of the winter he was lying on a moor among the reeds when the sun began to shine warmly again the larks sang and beautiful spring had returned  and once more he shook his wings they were stronger than formerly and bore him forwards quickly and before he was well aware of it he was in a large garden where the apple-trees stood in full bloom where the syringas sent forth their fragrance and hung their long green branches down into the winding canal oh everything was so lovely so full of the freshness of spring and out of the thicket came three beautiful white swans they displayed their feathers so proudly and swam so lightly so lightly the duckling knew the glorious creatures and was seized with a strange melancholy   i will fly to them those kingly birds  said he  they will kill me because i ugly as i am have presumed to approach them but it matters not better to be killed by them than to be bitten by the ducks pecked by the hens kicked by the girl who feeds the poultry and to have so much to suffer during the winter  he flew into the water and swam towards the beautiful creatures they saw him and shot forward to meet him  only kill me  said the poor animal and he bowed his head low expecting death but what did he see in the water he saw beneath him his own form no longer that of a plump ugly grey bird it was that of a swan  it matters not to have been born in a duck-yard if one has been hatched from a swan s egg  the good creature felt himself really elevated by all the troubles and adversities he had experienced he could now rightly estimate his own happiness and the larger swans swam round him and stroked him with their beaks  some little children were running about in the garden  [illustration  and every one said  the new one is the best ]  they threw grain and bread into the water and the youngest exclaimed  there is a new one  the others also cried out  yes there is a new swan come  and they clapped their hands and danced around they ran to their father and mother bread and cake were thrown into the water and every one said  the new one is the best so young and so beautiful  and the old swans bowed before him the young swan felt quite ashamed and hid his head under his wings he scarcely knew what to do he was all too happy but still not proud for a good heart is never proud  he remembered how he had been persecuted and derided and he now heard every one say he was the most beautiful of all beautiful birds the syringas bent down their branches towards him low into the water and the sun shone so warmly and brightly he shook his feathers stretched his slender neck and in the joy of his heart said  how little did i dream of so much happiness when i was the ugly despised duckling"@"the ugly duckling"@"hans christian andersen"
