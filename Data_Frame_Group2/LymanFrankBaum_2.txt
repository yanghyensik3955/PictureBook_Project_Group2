"the wind blew hard and joggled the water of the ocean sending ripples across its surface then the wind pushed the edges of the ripples until they became waves and shoved the waves around until they became billows the billows rolled dreadfully high  higher even than the tops of houses some of them indeed rolled as high as the tops of tall trees and seemed like mountains and the gulfs between the great billows were like deep valleys  all this mad dashing and splashing of the waters of the big ocean which the mischievous wind caused without any good reason whatever resulted in a terrible storm and a storm on the ocean is liable to cut many queer pranks and do a lot of damage  at the time the wind began to blow a ship was sailing far out upon the waters when the waves began to tumble and toss and to grow bigger and bigger the ship rolled up and down and tipped sidewise first one way and then the other and was jostled around so roughly that even the sailor-men had to hold fast to the ropes and railings to keep themselves from being swept away by the wind or pitched headlong into the sea  and the clouds were so thick in the sky that the sunlight couldn't get through them so that the day grew dark as night which added to the terrors of the storm  the captain of the ship was not afraid because he had seen storms before and had sailed his ship through them in safety but he knew that his passengers would be in danger if they tried to stay on deck so he put them all into the cabin and told them to stay there until after the storm was over and to keep brave hearts and not be scared and all would be well with them  now among these passengers was a little kansas girl named dorothy gale who was going with her uncle henry to australia to visit some relatives they had never before seen uncle henry you must know was not very well because he had been working so hard on his kansas farm that his health had given way and left him weak and nervous so he left aunt em at home to watch after the hired men and to take care of the farm while he traveled far away to australia to visit his cousins and have a good rest  dorothy was eager to go with him on this journey and uncle henry thought she would be good company and help cheer him up so he decided to take her along the little girl was quite an experienced traveller for she had once been carried by a cyclone as far away from home as the marvelous land of oz and she had met with a good many adventures in that strange country before she managed to get back to kansas again so she wasn't easily frightened whatever happened and when the wind began to howl and whistle and the waves began to tumble and toss our little girl didn't mind the uproar the least bit  of course we'll have to stay in the cabin she said to uncle henry and the other passengers and keep as quiet as possible until the storm is over for the captain says if we go on deck we may be blown overboard  no one wanted to risk such an accident as that you may be sure so all the passengers stayed huddled up in the dark cabin listening to the shrieking of the storm and the creaking of the masts and rigging and trying to keep from bumping into one another when the ship tipped sidewise  dorothy had almost fallen asleep when she was aroused with a start to find that uncle henry was missing she couldn't imagine where he had gone and as he was not very strong she began to worry about him and to fear he might have been careless enough to go on deck in that case he would be in great danger unless he instantly came down again  the fact was that uncle henry had gone to lie down in his little sleeping-berth but dorothy did not know that she only remembered that aunt em had cautioned her to take good care of her uncle so at once she decided to go on deck and find him in spite of the fact that the tempest was now worse than ever and the ship was plunging in a really dreadful manner indeed the little girl found it was as much as she could do to mount the stairs to the deck and as soon as she got there the wind struck her so fiercely that it almost tore away the skirts of her dress yet dorothy felt a sort of joyous excitement in defying the storm and while she held fast to the railing she peered around through the gloom and thought she saw the dim form of a man clinging to a mast not far away from her this might be her uncle so she called as loudly as she could   uncle henry uncle henry  illustration  uncle henry uncle henry called dorothy  but the wind screeched and howled so madly that she scarce heard her own voice and the man certainly failed to hear her for he did not move  dorothy decided she must go to him so she made a dash forward during a lull in the storm to where a big square chicken-coop had been lashed to the deck with ropes she reached this place in safety but no sooner had she seized fast hold of the slats of the big box in which the chickens were kept than the wind as if enraged because the little girl dared to resist its power suddenly redoubled its fury with a scream like that of an angry giant it tore away the ropes that held the coop and lifted it high into the air with dorothy still clinging to the slats around and over it whirled this way and that and a few moments later the chicken-coop dropped far away into the sea where the big waves caught it and slid it up-hill to a foaming crest and then downhill into a deep valley as if it were nothing more than a plaything to keep them amused  dorothy had a good ducking you may be sure but she didn't lose her presence of mind even for a second she kept tight hold of the stout slats and as soon as she could get the water out of her eyes she saw that the wind had ripped the cover from the coop and the poor chickens were fluttering away in every direction being blown by the wind until they looked like feather dusters without handles the bottom of the coop was made of thick boards so dorothy found she was clinging to a sort of raft with sides of slats which readily bore up her weight after coughing the water out of her throat and getting her breath again she managed to climb over the slats and stand upon the firm wooden bottom of the coop which supported her easily enough  why i've got a ship of my own she thought more amused than frightened at her sudden change of condition and then as the coop climbed up to the top of a big wave she looked eagerly around for the ship from which she had been blown  it was far far away by this time perhaps no one on board had yet missed her or knew of her strange adventure down into a valley between the waves the coop swept her and when she climbed another crest the ship looked like a toy boat it was such a long way off soon it had entirely disappeared in the gloom and then dorothy gave a sigh of regret at parting with uncle henry and began to wonder what was going to happen to her next  just now she was tossing on the bosom of a big ocean with nothing to keep her afloat but a miserable wooden hen-coop that had a plank bottom and slatted sides through which the water constantly splashed and wetted her through to the skin and there was nothing to eat when she became hungry as she was sure to do before long and no fresh water to drink and no dry clothes to put on  well i declare she exclaimed with a laugh you're in a pretty fix dorothy gale i can tell you and i haven't the least idea how you're going to get out of it  as if to add to her troubles the night was now creeping on and the gray clouds overhead changed to inky blackness but the wind as if satisfied at last with its mischievous pranks stopped blowing this ocean and hurried away to another part of the world to blow something else so that the waves not being joggled any more began to quiet down and behave themselves  illustration  dorothy afloat in the hen-coop  it was lucky for dorothy i think that the storm subsided otherwise brave though she was i fear she might have perished many children in her place would have wept and given way to despair but because dorothy had encountered so many adventures and come safely through them it did not occur to her at this time to be especially afraid she was wet and uncomfortable it is true but after sighing that one sigh i told you of she managed to recall some of her customary cheerfulness and decided to patiently await whatever her fate might be  by and by the black clouds rolled away and showed a blue sky overhead with a silver moon shining sweetly in the middle of it and little stars winking merrily at dorothy when she looked their way the coop did not toss around any more but rode the waves more gently almost like a cradle rocking so that the floor upon which dorothy stood was no longer swept by water coming through the slats seeing this and being quite exhausted by the excitement of the past few hours the little girl decided that sleep would be the best thing to restore her strength and the easiest way in which she could pass the time the floor was damp and she was herself wringing wet but fortunately this was a warm climate and she did not feel at all cold so she sat down in a corner of the coop leaned her back against the slats nodded at the friendly stars before she closed her eyes and was asleep in half a minute  "@"ozma of oz"@"lyman frank baum"
"the cyclone   dorothy lived in the midst of the great kansas prairies with uncle henry who was a farmer and aunt em who was the farmer’s wife their house was small for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles there were four walls a floor and a roof which made one room and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove a cupboard for the dishes a table three or four chairs and the beds uncle henry and aunt em had a big bed in one corner and dorothy a little bed in another corner there was no garret at all and no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground called a cyclone cellar where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose mighty enough to crush any building in its path it was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor from which a ladder led down into the small dark hole  when dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every side not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions the sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass with little cracks running through it even the grass was not green for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere once the house had been painted but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else  when aunt em came there to live she was a young pretty wife the sun and wind had changed her too they had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them a sober gray they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips and they were gray also she was thin and gaunt and never smiled now when dorothy who was an orphan first came to her aunt em had been so startled by the child’s laughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart whenever dorothy’s merry voice reached her ears and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at  uncle henry never laughed he worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was he was gray also from his long beard to his rough boots and he looked stern and solemn and rarely spoke  it was toto that made dorothy laugh and saved her from growing as gray as her other surroundings toto was not gray he was a little black dog with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of his funny wee nose toto played all day long and dorothy played with him and loved him dearly  today however they were not playing uncle henry sat upon the doorstep and looked anxiously at the sky which was even grayer than usual dorothy stood in the door with toto in her arms and looked at the sky too aunt em was washing the dishes  from the far north they heard a low wail of the wind and uncle henry and dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm there now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that direction also  suddenly uncle henry stood up  there’s a cyclone coming em he called to his wife i’ll go look after the stock then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and horses were kept  aunt em dropped her work and came to the door one glance told her of the danger close at hand  quick dorothy she screamed run for the cellar  toto jumped out of dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed and the girl started to get him aunt em badly frightened threw open the trap door in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small dark hole dorothy caught toto at last and started to follow her aunt when she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the wind and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor  then a strange thing happened  the house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon  the north and south winds met where the house stood and made it the exact center of the cyclone in the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it up higher and higher until it was at the very top of the cyclone and there it remained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry a feather  it was very dark and the wind howled horribly around her but dorothy found she was riding quite easily after the first few whirls around and one other time when the house tipped badly she felt as if she were being rocked gently like a baby in a cradle  toto did not like it he ran about the room now here now there barking loudly but dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what would happen  once toto got too near the open trap door and fell in and at first the little girl thought she had lost him but soon she saw one of his ears sticking up through the hole for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so that he could not fall she crept to the hole caught toto by the ear and dragged him into the room again afterward closing the trap door so that no more accidents could happen  hour after hour passed away and slowly dorothy got over her fright but she felt quite lonely and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that she nearly became deaf at first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieces when the house fell again but as the hours passed and nothing terrible happened she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what the future would bring at last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed and lay down upon it and toto followed and lay down beside her  in spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind dorothy soon closed her eyes and fell fast asleep"@"the wonderful wizard of oz"@"lyman frank baum"
