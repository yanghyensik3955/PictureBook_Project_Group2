"one morning a little rabbit sat on a bank.  he pricked his ears and listened to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony.  a gig was coming along the road; it was driven by mr. mcgregor, and beside him sat mrs. mcgregor in her best bonnet.  as soon as they had passed, little benjamin bunny slid down into the road, and set off--with a hop, skip, and a jump--to call upon his relations, who lived in the wood at the back of mr. mcgregor's garden.      that wood was full of rabbit holes; and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all lived benjamin's aunt and his cousins--flopsy, mopsy, cotton-tail, and peter.  old mrs. rabbit was a widow; she earned her living by knitting rabbit-wool mittens and muffatees (i once bought a pair at a bazaar). she also sold herbs, and rosemary tea, and rabbit-tobacco (which is what we call lavender).  little benjamin did not very much want to see his aunt.  he came round the back of the fir-tree, and nearly tumbled upon the top of his cousin peter.      peter was sitting by himself. he looked poorly, and was dressed in a red cotton pocket-handkerchief.  peter, said little benjamin, in a whisper, who has got your clothes?  peter replied, the scarecrow in mr. mcgregor's garden, and described how he had been chased about the garden, and had dropped his shoes and coat.  little benjamin sat down beside his cousin and assured him that mr. mcgregor had gone out in a gig, and mrs. mcgregor also; and certainly for the day, because she was wearing her best bonnet.      peter said he hoped that it would rain.  at this point old mrs. rabbit's voice was heard inside the rabbit hole, calling: cotton-tail! cotton-tail! fetch some more camomile!  peter said he thought he might feel better if he went for a walk.  they went away hand in hand, and got upon the flat top of the wall at the bottom of the wood. from here they looked down into mr. mcgregor's garden. peter's coat and shoes were plainly to be seen upon the scarecrow, topped with an old tam-o'-shanter of mr. mcgregor's.      little benjamin said: it spoils people's clothes to squeeze under a gate; the proper way to get in is to climb down a pear-tree.  peter fell down head first; but it was of no consequence, as the bed below was newly raked and quite soft.  it had been sown with lettuces.  they left a great many odd little footmarks all over the bed, especially little benjamin, who was wearing clogs.      little benjamin said that the first thing to be done was to get back peter's clothes, in order that they might be able to use the pocket-handkerchief.  they took them off the scarecrow. there had been rain during the night; there was water in the shoes, and the coat was somewhat shrunk.  benjamin tried on the tam-o'-shanter, but it was too big for him.  then he suggested that they should fill the pocket-handkerchief with onions, as a little present for his aunt.  peter did not seem to be enjoying himself; he kept hearing noises.       benjamin, on the contrary, was perfectly at home, and ate a lettuce leaf. he said that he was in the habit of coming to the garden with his father to get lettuces for their sunday dinner.  (the name of little benjamin's papa was old mr. benjamin bunny.)  the lettuces certainly were very fine.  peter did not eat anything; he said he should like to go home. presently he dropped half the onions.      little benjamin said that it was not possible to get back up the pear-tree with a load of vegetables. he led the way boldly towards the other end of the garden. they went along a little walk on planks, under a sunny, red brick wall.  the mice sat on their doorsteps cracking cherry-stones; they winked at peter rabbit and little benjamin bunny.  presently peter let the pocket-handkerchief go again.      they got amongst flower-pots, and frames, and tubs. peter heard noises worse than ever; his eyes were as big as lolly-pops!  he was a step or two in front of his cousin when he suddenly stopped.  this is what those little rabbits saw round that corner!  little benjamin took one look, and then, in half a minute less than no time, he hid himself and peter and the onions underneath a large basket....      the cat got up and stretched herself, and came and sniffed at the basket.  perhaps she liked the smell of onions!  anyway, she sat down upon the top of the basket.  she sat there for five hours.         *       *       *       *       *  i cannot draw you a picture of peter and benjamin underneath the basket, because it was quite dark, and because the smell of onions was fearful; it made peter rabbit and little benjamin cry.  the sun got round behind the wood, and it was quite late in the afternoon; but still the cat sat upon the basket.      at length there was a pitter-patter, pitter-patter, and some bits of mortar fell from the wall above.  the cat looked up and saw old mr. benjamin bunny prancing along the top of the wall of the upper terrace.  he was smoking a pipe of rabbit-tobacco, and had a little switch in his hand.  he was looking for his son.  old mr. bunny had no opinion whatever of cats.  he took a tremendous jump off the top of the wall on to the top of the cat, and cuffed it off the basket, and kicked it into the greenhouse, scratching off a handful of fur.  the cat was too much surprised to scratch back.      when old mr. bunny had driven the cat into the greenhouse, he locked the door.  then he came back to the basket and took out his son benjamin by the ears, and whipped him with the little switch.  then he took out his nephew peter.  then he took out the handkerchief of onions, and marched out of the garden.    when mr. mcgregor returned about half an hour later he observed several things which perplexed him.  it looked as though some person had been walking all over the garden in a pair of clogs--only the footmarks were too ridiculously little!  also he could not understand how the cat could have managed to shut herself up inside the greenhouse, locking the door upon the outside.      when peter got home his mother forgave him, because she was so glad to see that he had found his shoes and coat. cotton-tail and peter folded up the pocket-handkerchief, and old mrs. rabbit strung up the onions and hung them from the kitchen ceiling, with the bunches of herbs and the rabbit-tobacco.",the tale of benjamin bunny,beatrix potter,
"a farmyard tale     for     ralph and betsy      what a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen!  --listen to the story of jemima puddle-duck, who was annoyed because the farmer's wife would not let her hatch her own eggs.    her sister-in-law, mrs. rebeccah puddle-duck, was perfectly willing to leave the hatching to some one else--i have not the patience to sit on a nest for twenty-eight days; and no more have you, jemima. you would let them go cold; you know you would!  i wish to hatch my own eggs; i will hatch them all by myself, quacked jemima puddle-duck.    she tried to hide her eggs; but they were always found and carried off.  jemima puddle-duck became quite desperate. she determined to make a nest right away from the farm.    she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cart-road that leads over the hill.  she was wearing a shawl and a poke bonnet.    when she reached the top of the hill, she saw a wood in the distance.  she thought that it looked a safe quiet spot.    jemima puddle-duck was not much in the habit of flying. she ran downhill a few yards flapping her shawl, and then she jumped off into the air.    she flew beautifully when she had got a good start.  she skimmed along over the tree-tops until she saw an open place in the middle of the wood, where the trees and brushwood had been cleared.    jemima alighted rather heavily, and began to waddle about in search of a convenient dry nesting-place. she rather fancied a tree-stump amongst some tall fox-gloves.  but--seated upon the stump, she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper.  he had black prick ears and sandy coloured whiskers.  quack? said jemima puddle-duck, with her head and her bonnet on one side--quack?    the gentleman raised his eyes above his newspaper and looked curiously at jemima--  madam, have you lost your way? said he. he had a long bushy tail which he was sitting upon, as the stump was somewhat damp.  jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome. she explained that she had not lost her way, but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting-place.    ah! is that so? indeed! said the gentleman with sandy whiskers, looking curiously at jemima. he folded up the newspaper, and put it in his coat-tail pocket.  jemima complained of the superfluous hen.  indeed! how interesting! i wish i could meet with that fowl. i would teach it to mind its own business!    but as to a nest--there is no difficulty: i have a sackful of feathers in my wood-shed. no, my dear madam, you will be in nobody's way. you may sit there as long as you like, said the bushy long-tailed gentleman.  he led the way to a very retired, dismal-looking house amongst the fox-gloves.  it was built of faggots and turf, and there were two broken pails, one on top of another, by way of a chimney.    this is my summer residence; you would not find my earth--my winter house--so convenient, said the hospitable gentleman.  there was a tumble-down shed at the back of the house, made of old soap-boxes. the gentleman opened the door, and showed jemima in.    the shed was almost quite full of feathers--it was almost suffocating; but it was comfortable and very soft.  jemima puddle-duck was rather surprised to find such a vast quantity of feathers. but it was very comfortable; and she made a nest without any trouble at all.    when she came out, the sandy whiskered gentleman was sitting on a log reading the newspaper--at least he had it spread out, but he was looking over the top of it.  he was so polite, that he seemed almost sorry to let jemima go home for the night. he promised to take great care of her nest until she came back again next day.  he said he loved eggs and ducklings; he should be proud to see a fine nestful in his wood-shed.    jemima puddle-duck came every afternoon; she laid nine eggs in the nest. they were greeny white and very large. the foxy gentleman admired them immensely. he used to turn them over and count them when jemima was not there.  at last jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit next day--and i will bring a bag of corn with me, so that i need never leave my nest until the eggs are hatched. they might catch cold, said the conscientious jemima.    madam, i beg you not to trouble yourself with a bag; i will provide oats. but before you commence your tedious sitting, i intend to give you a treat. let us have a dinner-party all to ourselves!  may i ask you to bring up some herbs from the farm-garden to make a savoury omelette? sage and thyme, and mint and two onions, and some parsley. i will provide lard for the stuff--lard for the omelette, said the hospitable gentleman with sandy whiskers.    jemima puddle-duck was a simpleton: not even the mention of sage and onions made her suspicious.  she went round the farm-garden, nibbling off snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck.    and she waddled into the kitchen, and got two onions out of a basket.  the collie-dog kep met her coming out, what are you doing with those onions? where do you go every afternoon by yourself, jemima puddle-duck?  jemima was rather in awe of the collie; she told him the whole story.  the collie listened, with his wise head on one side; he grinned when she described the polite gentleman with sandy whiskers.    he asked several questions about the wood, and about the exact position of the house and shed.  then he went out, and trotted down the village. he went to look for two fox-hound puppies who were out at walk with the butcher.    jemima puddle-duck went up the cart-road for the last time, on a sunny afternoon. she was rather burdened with bunches of herbs and two onions in a bag.  she flew over the wood, and alighted opposite the house of the bushy long-tailed gentleman.    he was sitting on a log; he sniffed the air, and kept glancing uneasily round the wood. when jemima alighted he quite jumped.  come into the house as soon as you have looked at your eggs. give me the herbs for the omelette. be sharp!  he was rather abrupt. jemima puddle-duck had never heard him speak like that.  she felt surprised, and uncomfortable.    while she was inside she heard pattering feet round the back of the shed. some one with a black nose sniffed at the bottom of the door, and then locked it.  jemima became much alarmed.    a moment afterwards there were most awful noises--barking, baying, growls and howls, squealing and groans.  and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy-whiskered gentleman.  presently kep opened the door of the shed, and let out jemima puddle-duck.    unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up all the eggs before he could stop them.  he had a bite on his ear and both the puppies were limping.    jemima puddle-duck was escorted home in tears on account of those eggs.    she laid some more in june, and she was permitted to keep them herself: but only four of them hatched.  jemima puddle-duck said that it was because of her nerves; but she had always been a bad sitter.",the tale of jemima puddle-duck,beatrix potter,
"once upon a time there was a little girl called lucie, who lived at a farm called little-town. she was a good little girl--only she was always losing her pocket-handkerchiefs!  one day little lucie came into the farm-yard crying--oh, she did cry so! i've lost my pocket-handkin! three handkins and a pinny! have you seen them, tabby kitten?    the kitten went on washing her white paws; so lucie asked a speckled hen--  sally henny-penny, have you found three pocket-handkins?  but the speckled hen ran into a barn, clucking--  i go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!      and then lucie asked cock robin sitting on a twig.  cock robin looked sideways at lucie with his bright black eye, and he flew over a stile and away.  lucie climbed upon the stile and looked up at the hill behind little-town--a hill that goes up--up--into the clouds as though it had no top!  and a great way up the hill-side she thought she saw some white things spread upon the grass.    lucie scrambled up the hill as fast as her stout legs would carry her; she ran along a steep path-way--up and up--until little-town was right away down below--she could have dropped a pebble down the chimney!    presently she came to a spring, bubbling out from the hill-side.  some one had stood a tin can upon a stone to catch the water--but the water was already running over, for the can was no bigger than an egg-cup! and where the sand upon the path was wet--there were foot-marks of a very small person.  lucie ran on, and on.    the path ended under a big rock. the grass was short and green, and there were clothes--props cut from bracken stems, with lines of plaited rushes, and a heap of tiny clothes pins--but no pocket-handkerchiefs!  but there was something else--a door! straight into the hill; and inside it some one was singing--      lily-white and clean, oh!      with little frills between, oh!       smooth and hot--red rusty spot      never here be seen, oh!    lucie, knocked--once--twice, and interrupted the song. a little frightened voice called out who's that?  lucie opened the door: and what do you think there was inside the hill?--a nice clean kitchen with a flagged floor and wooden beams--just like any other farm kitchen. only the ceiling was so low that lucie's head nearly touched it; and the pots and pans were small, and so was everything there.    there was a nice hot singey smell; and at the table, with an iron in her hand stood a very stout short person staring anxiously at lucie.  her print gown was tucked up, and she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat. her little black nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and underneath her cap--where lucie had yellow curls--that little person had prickles!    who are you? said lucie. have you seen my pocket-handkins?  the little person made a bob-curtsey--oh, yes, if you please'm; my name is mrs. tiggy-winkle; oh, yes if you please'm, i'm an excellent clear-starcher! and she took something out of a clothes-basket, and spread it on the ironing-blanket.    what's that thing? said lucie--that's not my pocket-handkin?  oh no, if you please'm; that's a little scarlet waist-coat belonging to cock robin!  and she ironed it and folded it, and put it on one side.    then she took something else off a clothes-horse--  that isn't my pinny? said lucie.  oh no, if you please'm; that's a damask table-cloth belonging to jenny wren; look how it's stained with currant wine! it's very bad to wash! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    mrs. tiggy-winkle's nose went sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes went twinkle, twinkle; and she fetched another hot iron from the fire.    there's one of my pocket-handkins! cried lucie--and there's my pinny!  mrs. tiggy-winkle ironed it, and goffered it, and shook out the frills.  oh that is lovely! said lucie.    and what are those long yellow things with fingers like gloves?  oh, that's a pair of stockings belonging to sally henny-penny--look how she's worn the heels out with scratching in the yard! she'll very soon go barefoot! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    why, there's another handkersniff--but it isn't mine; it's red?  oh no, if you please'm; that one belongs to old mrs. rabbit; and it did so smell of onions! i've had to wash it separately, i can't get out the smell.  there's another one of mine, said lucie.    what are those funny little white things?  that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten; i only have to iron them; she washes them herself.  there's my last pocket-handkin! said lucie.    and what are you dipping into the basin of starch?  they're little dicky shirt-fronts belonging to tom titmouse--most terrible particular! said mrs. tiggy-winkle. now i've finished my ironing; i'm going to air some clothes.    what are these dear soft fluffy things? said lucie.  oh those are woolly coats belonging to the little lambs at skelghyl.  will their jackets take off? asked lucie.  oh yes, if you please'm; look at the sheep-mark on the shoulder. and here's one marked for gatesgarth, and three that come from little-town. they're always marked at washing! said mrs. tiggy-winkle.    and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes--small brown coats of mice; and one velvety black moleskin waist-coat; and a red tailcoat with no tail belonging to squirrel nutkin; and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit; and a petticoat, not marked, that had gone lost in the washing--and at last the basket was empty!    then mrs. tiggy-winkle made tea--a cup for herself and a cup for lucie. they sat before the fire on a bench and looked sideways at one another. mrs. tiggy-winkle's hand, holding the tea-cup, was very very brown, and very very wrinkly with the soap-suds; and all through her gown and her cap, there were hair-pins sticking wrong end out; so that lucie didn't like to sit too near her.    when they had finished tea, they tied up the clothes in bundles; and lucie's pocket-handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny, and fastened with a silver safety-pin.  and then they made up the fire with turf, and came out and locked the door, and hid the key under the door-sill.    then away down the hill trotted lucie and mrs. tiggy-winkle with the bundles of clothes!  all the way down the path little animals came out of the fern to meet them; the very first that they met were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny!    and she gave them their nice clean clothes; and all the little animals and birds were so very much obliged to dear mrs. tiggy-winkle.    so that at the bottom of the hill when they came to the stile, there was nothing left to carry except lucie's one little bundle.    lucie scrambled up the stile with the bundle in her hand; and then she turned to say good-night, and to thank the washer-woman--but what a very odd thing! mrs. tiggy-winkle had not waited either for thanks or for the washing bill!  she was running running running up the hill--and where was her white frilled cap? and her shawl? and her gown--and her petticoat?    and how small she had grown--and how brown--and covered with prickles!  why! mrs. tiggy-winkle was nothing but a hedgehog.         *       *       *       *       *      (now some people say that little lucie had been asleep upon the     stile--but then how could she have found three clean     pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin?      and besides--i have seen that door into the back of the hill     called cat bells--and besides i am very well acquainted with     dear mrs. tiggy-winkle!)",the tale of mrs. tiggy-winkle,beatrix potter ,
"once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were--            flopsy,        mopsy,    cotton-tail, and peter.  they lived with their mother in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir-tree.  'now my dears,' said old mrs. rabbit one morning, 'you may go into the fields or down the lane, but don't go into mr. mcgregor's garden: your father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by mrs. mcgregor.'  'now run along, and don't get into mischief. i am going out.'  then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella, and went through the wood to the baker's. she bought a loaf of brown bread and five currant buns.  flopsy, mopsy, and cottontail, who were good little bunnies, went down the lane to gather blackberries:  but peter, who was very naughty, ran straight away to mr. mcgregor's garden, and squeezed under the gate!  first he ate some lettuces and some french beans; and then he ate some radishes;  and then, feeling rather sick, he went to look for some parsley.  but round the end of a cucumber frame, whom should he meet but mr. mcgregor!  mr. mcgregor was on his hands and knees planting out young cabbages, but he jumped up and ran after peter, waving a rake and calling out, 'stop thief!'  peter was most dreadfully frightened; he rushed all over the garden, for he had forgotten the way back to the gate.  he lost one of his shoes among the cabbages, and the other shoe amongst the potatoes.  after losing them, he ran on four legs and went faster, so that i think he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately run into a gooseberry net, and got caught by the large buttons on his jacket. it was a blue jacket with brass buttons, quite new.  peter gave himself up for lost, and shed big tears; but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows, who flew to him in great excitement, and implored him to exert himself.  mr. mcgregor came up with a sieve, which he intended to pop upon the top of peter; but peter wriggled out just in time, leaving his jacket behind him.  and rushed into the tool-shed, and jumped into a can. it would have been a beautiful thing to hide in, if it had not had so much water in it.  mr. mcgregor was quite sure that peter was somewhere in the tool-shed, perhaps hidden underneath a flower-pot. he began to turn them over carefully, looking under each.  presently peter sneezed--'kertyschoo!' mr. mcgregor was after him in no time.  and tried to put his foot upon peter, who jumped out of a window, upsetting three plants. the window was too small for mr. mcgregor, and he was tired of running after peter. he went back to his work.  peter sat down to rest; he was out of breath and trembling with fright, and he had not the least idea which way to go. also he was very damp with sitting in that can.  after a time he began to wander about, going lippity--lippity--not very fast, and looking all round.  he found a door in a wall; but it was locked, and there was no room for a fat little rabbit to squeeze underneath.  an old mouse was running in and out over the stone doorstep, carrying peas and beans to her family in the wood. peter asked her the way to the gate, but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she could not answer. she only shook her head at him. peter began to cry.  then he tried to find his way straight across the garden, but he became more and more puzzled. presently, he came to a pond where mr. mcgregor filled his water-cans. a white cat was staring at some gold-fish, she sat very, very still, but now and then the tip of her tail twitched as if it were alive. peter thought it best to go away without speaking to her; he had heard about cats from his cousin, little benjamin bunny.  he went back towards the tool-shed, but suddenly, quite close to him, he heard the noise of a hoe--scr-r-ritch, scratch, scratch, scritch. peter scuttered underneath the bushes. but presently, as nothing happened, he came out, and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over. the first thing he saw was mr. mcgregor hoeing onions. his back was turned towards peter, and beyond him was the gate!  peter got down very quietly off the wheelbarrow; and started running as fast as he could go, along a straight walk behind some black-currant bushes.  mr. mcgregor caught sight of him at the corner, but peter did not care. he slipped underneath the gate, and was safe at last in the wood outside the garden.  mr. mcgregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes for a scare-crow to frighten the blackbirds.  peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree.  he was so tired that he flopped down upon the nice soft sand on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes. his mother was busy cooking; she wondered what he had done with his clothes. it was the second little jacket and pair of shoes that peter had lost in a fortnight!  i am sorry to say that peter was not very well during the evening.  his mother put him to bed, and made some camomile tea; and she gave a dose of it to peter!  'one table-spoonful to be taken at bed-time.'  but flopsy, mopsy, and cotton-tail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper.",red riding hood and other stories,beatrix potter,
"this is a tale about a tail--a tail that belonged to a little red squirrel, and his name was nutkin.  he had a brother called twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived in a wood at the edge of a lake.    in the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the house of an owl who is called old brown.    one autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes were golden and green--nutkin and twinkleberry and all the other little squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.    they made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water to owl island to gather nuts.  each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail for a sail.    they also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for old brown, and put them down upon his door-step.  then twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and said politely--  old mr. brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon your island?    but nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. he bobbed up and down like a little red cherry, singing--      riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!      a little wee man, in a red red coat!      a staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;      if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a groat.  now this riddle is as old as the hills; mr. brown paid no attention whatever to nutkin.  he shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in the evening.    but next morning they all came back again to owl island; and twinkleberry and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front of old brown's doorway, and said--  mr. brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather some more nuts?    but nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old mr. brown with a nettle and singing--      old mr. b! riddle-me-ree!      hitty pitty within the wall,      hitty pitty without the wall;      if you touch hitty pitty,      hitty pitty will bite you!  mr. brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.    he shut the door in nutkin's face. presently a little thread of blue smoke from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and nutkin peeped through the key-hole and sang--      a house full, a hole full!      and you cannot gather a bowl-full!      the squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their little sacks.  but nutkin gathered oak-apples--yellow and scarlet--and sat upon a beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old mr. brown.    on the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they caught seven fat minnows as a present for old brown.  they paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on owl island.    twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. he ran in front, singing--      the man in the wilderness said to me,     'how many strawberries grow in the sea?'      i answered him as i thought good--      'as many red herrings as grow in the wood.'  but old mr. brown took no interest in riddles--not even when the answer was provided for him.    on the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles, which were as good as plums in plum-pudding for old brown. each beetle was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.  but nutkin sang as rudely as ever--       old mr. b! riddle-me-ree       flour of england, fruit of spain,       met together in a shower of rain;       put in a bag tied round with a string,     if you'll tell me this riddle, i'll give you a ring!   which was ridiculous of nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to old brown.    the other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-needle pins.    on the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon the stone. they had stolen it out of a bumble bees' nest on the tippitty top of the hill.  but nutkin skipped up and down, singing--      hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! hum-a-bum buzz!       as i went over tipple-tine       i met a flock of bonny swine;     some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!       they were the very bonniest swine       that e'er went over tipple-tine.    old mr. brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of nutkin.  but he ate up the honey!    the squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.  but nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple and green fir-cones.    on the sixth day, which was saturday, the squirrels came again for the last time; they brought a new-laid egg in a little rush basket as a last parting present for old brown.  but nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting--      humpty dumpty lies in the beck,      with a white counterpane round his neck,      forty doctors and forty wrights,      cannot put humpty dumpty to rights!    now old mr. brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it again. but still he did not speak.    nutkin became more and more impertinent--        old mr. b! old mr. b!     hickamore, hackamore, on the king's kitchen door;     all the king's horses, and all the king's men,     couldn't drive hickamore, hackamore,     off the king's kitchen door.  nutkin danced up and down like a sunbeam; but still old brown said nothing at all.    nutkin began again--      arthur o'bower has broken his band,      he comes roaring up the land!      the king of scots with all his power,      cannot turn arthur of the bower!  nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the wind, and he took a running jump right onto the head of old brown!...  then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud squeak!  the other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.    when they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree--there was old brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if nothing had happened.         *       *       *       *       *  but nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!    this looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.    old brown carried nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail, intending to skin him; but nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic window.    and to this day, if you meet nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout--  cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k!",the tale of squirrel nutkin,beatrix potter ,
"once upon a time there were three little kittens, and their names were mittens, tom kitten, and moppet.  they had dear little fur coats of their own; and they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust.  but one day their mother--mrs. tabitha twitchit--expected friends to tea; so she fetched the kittens indoors, to wash and dress them, before the fine company arrived.      first she scrubbed their faces (this one is moppet).  then she brushed their fur, (this one is mittens).      then she combed their tails and whiskers (this is tom kitten).  tom was very naughty, and he scratched.  mrs. tabitha dressed moppet and mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers; and then she took all sorts of elegant uncomfortable clothes out of a chest of drawers, in order to dress up her son thomas.      tom kitten was very fat, and he had grown; several buttons burst off. his mother sewed them on again.  when the three kittens were ready, mrs. tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden, to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast.  now keep your frocks clean, children! you must walk on your hind legs. keep away from the dirty ash-pit, and from sally henny penny, and from the pig-stye and the puddle-ducks.      moppet and mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily. presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses.  when they stood up there were several green smears!  let us climb up the rockery, and sit on the garden wall, said moppet.  they turned their pinafores back to front, and went up with a skip and a jump; moppet's white tucker fell down into the road.      tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs in trousers. he came up the rockery by degrees, breaking the ferns, and shedding buttons right and left.  he was all in pieces when he reached the top of the wall.  moppet and mittens tried to pull him together; his hat fell off, and the rest of his buttons burst.      while they were in difficulties, there was a pit pat paddle pat! and the three puddle-ducks came along the hard high road, marching one behind the other and doing the goose step--pit pat paddle pat! pit pat waddle pat!  they stopped and stood in a row, and stared up at the kittens. they had very small eyes and looked surprised.      then the two duck-birds, rebeccah and jemima puddle-duck, picked up the hat and tucker and put them on.  mittens laughed so that she fell off the wall. moppet and tom descended after her; the pinafores and all the rest of tom's clothes came off on the way down.  come! mr. drake puddle-duck, said moppet--come and help us to dress him! come and button up tom!      mr. drake puddle-duck advanced in a slow sideways manner, and picked up the various articles.  but he put them on himself! they fitted him even worse than tom kitten.  it's a very fine morning! said mr. drake puddle-duck.      and he and jemima and rebeccah puddle-duck set off up the road, keeping step--pit pat, paddle pat! pit pat, waddle pat!  then tabitha twitchit came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on.      she pulled them off the wall, smacked them, and took them back to the house.  my friends will arrive in a minute, and you are not fit to be seen; i am affronted, said mrs. tabitha twitchit.  she sent them upstairs; and i am sorry to say she told her friends that they were in bed with the measles; which was not true.      quite the contrary; they were not in bed: not in the least.  somehow there were very extraordinary noises over-head, which disturbed the dignity and repose of the tea party.  and i think that some day i shall have to make another, larger, book, to tell you more about tom kitten!    as for the puddle-ducks--they went into a pond.  the clothes all came off directly, because there were no buttons.      and mr. drake puddle-duck, and jemima and rebeccah, have been looking for them ever since.",the tale of tom kitten,beatrix potter,

the golden goose there was once a man who had three sons the youngest of whom was called the simpleton he was laughed at and despised and neglected on all occasions now it happened one day that the eldest son wanted to go into the forest to hew wood and his mother gave him a beautiful cake and a bottle of wine to take with him so that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst when he came to the wood he met a little old grey man who bidding him good-day said  give me a small piece of the cake in your wallet and let me drink a mouthful of your wine i am so hungry and thirsty but the clever son answered  if i were to give you my cake and wine i should have none for myself so be off with you and he left the little man standing there and walked away hardly had he begun to hew down a tree when his axe slipped and cut his arm so that he had to go home at once and have the wound bound up this was the work of the little grey man  thereupon the second son went into the wood and the mother gave him as she had given to the eldest a sweet cake and a bottle of wine the little old man met him also and begged for a small slice of cake and a drink of wine but the second son spoke out quite plainly what i give to you i lose myself be off with you and he left the little man standing there and walked on punishment was not long in coming to him for he had given but two strokes at a tree when he cut his leg so badly that he had to be carried home  then said the simpleton  father let me go into the forest and hew wood but his father answered him  your brothers have done themselves much harm so as you understand nothing about wood-cutting you had better not try but the simpleton begged for so long that at last the father said  well go if you like experience will soon make you wiser to him the mother gave a cake but it was made with water and had been baked in the ashes and with it she gave him a bottle of sour beer when he came to the wood the little grey man met him also and greeted him and said  give me a slice of your cake and a drink from your bottle i am so hungry and thirsty the simpleton replied  i have only a cake that has been baked in the ashes and some sour beer but if that will satisfy you let us sit down and eat together so they sat themselves down and as the simpleton held out his food it became a rich cake and the sour beer became good wine so they ate and drank together and when the meal was finished the little man said  as you have a good heart and give so willingly a share of your own i will grant you good luck yonder stands an old tree hew it down and in its roots you will find something saying this the old man took his departure and off went the simpleton and cut down the tree when it fell there among its roots sat a goose with feathers of pure gold he lifted her out and carried her with him to an inn where he intended to stay the night  now the innkeeper had three daughters who on seeing the goose were curious to know what wonderful kind of a bird it could be and longed to have one of its golden feathers the eldest daughter thought to herself surely a chance will come for me to pull out one of those feathers and so when the simpleton had gone out she caught the goose by the wing but there her hand stuck fast shortly afterwards the second daughter came as she too was longing for a golden feather she had hardly touched her sister however when she also stuck fast and lastly came the third daughter with the same object at this the others cried out keep off for goodness' sake keep off but she not understanding why they told her to keep away thought to herself if they go to the goose why should not i she sprang forward but as she touched her sister she too stuck fast and pull as she might she could not get away and thus they had all to pass the night beside the goose  the next morning the simpleton took the goose under his arm and went on his way without troubling himself at all about the three girls who were hanging to the bird there they went always running behind him now to the right now to the left whichever way he chose to go in the middle of the fields they met the parson and when he saw the procession he called out shame on you you naughty girls why do you run after a young fellow in this way come leave go with this he caught the youngest by the hand and tried to pull her back but when he touched her he found he could not get away and he too must needs run behind then the sexton came along and saw the parson following on the heels of the three girls this so astonished him that he called out hi sir parson whither away so fast do you forget that today we have a christening and ran after him and caught him by the coat but he too remained sticking fast  as the five now ran on one behind the other two labourers who were returning from the field with their tools came along the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free no sooner had they touched the sexton than they too had to hang on and now there were seven running after the simpleton and the goose  in this way they came to a city where a king reigned who had an only daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh therefore he had announced that whoever should make her laugh should have her for his wife when the simpleton heard this he went with his goose and his train before the princess and when she saw the seven people all running behind each other she began to laugh and she laughed and laughed till it seemed as though she could never stop thereupon the simpleton demanded her for his wife but the king was not pleased at the thought of such a son-in-law and he made all kinds of objections he told the simpleton that he must first bring him a man who could drink off a whole cellarful of wine at once the simpleton thought of the little grey man who would be sure to help him so off he went into the wood and in the place where he had cut down the tree he saw a man sitting who looked most miserable the simpleton asked him what was the cause of his trouble  i have such a thirst the man answered and i cannot quench it i cannot bear cold water i have indeed emptied a cask of wine but what is a drop like that to a thirsty man  in that case i can help you said the simpleton just come with me and you shall be satisfied  he led him to the king's cellar and the man at once sat down in front of the great cask and drank and drank till before a day was over he had drunk the whole cellarful of wine then the simpleton demanded his bride again but the king was angry that a mean fellow everyone called a simpleton should win his daughter and he made new conditions before giving him his daughter to wife he said that the simpleton must find a man who would eat a whole mountain of bread the simpleton did not stop long to consider but went off straight to the wood there in the same place as before sat a man who was buckling a strap tightly around him and looking very depressed he said   i have eaten a whole ovenful of loaves but what help is that when a man is as hungry as i am i feel quite empty and i must strap myself together if i am not to die of hunger  the simpleton was delighted on hearing this and said  get up at once and come with me i will give you enough to eat to satisfy your hunger  he led him to the king who meanwhile had ordered all the meal in the kingdom to be brought together and an immense mountain of bread baked from it the man from the wood set to work on it and in one day the whole mountain had disappeared  for the third time the simpleton demanded his bride but yet again the king tried to put him off and said that he must bring him a ship that would go both on land and water  if you are really able to sail such a ship said he you shall at once have my daughter for your wife  the simpleton went into the wood and there sat the little old grey man to whom he had given his cake  i have drunk for you and i have eaten for you said the little man and i will also give you the ship all this i do for you because you were kind to me  then he gave the simpleton a ship that went both on land and water and when the king saw it he knew he could no longer keep back his daughter the wedding was celebrated and after the king's death the simpleton inherited the kingdom and lived very happily ever after with his wife      the story of the three bears   once upon a time there were three bears who lived together in a house of their own in a wood one of them was a little small wee bear and one was a middle-sized bear and the other was a great huge bear they had each a pot for their porridge a little pot for the little small wee bear and a middle-sized pot for the middle bear and a great pot for the great huge bear and they had each a chair to sit in a little chair for the little small wee bear and a middle-sized chair for the middle bear and a great chair for the great huge bear and they had each a bed to sleep in a little bed for the little small wee bear and a middle-sized bed for the middle bear and a great bed for the great huge bear  one day after they had made the porridge for their breakfast and poured it into their porridge-pots they walked out into the wood while the porridge was cooling that they might not burn their mouths by beginning too soon to eat it and while they were walking a little girl called goldenlocks came to the house first she looked in at the window and then she peeped in at the keyhole and seeing nobody in the house she turned the handle of the door the door was not fastened because the bears were good bears who did nobody any harm and never suspected that anybody would harm them so goldenlocks opened the door and went in and well pleased she was when she saw the porridge on the table if she had been a thoughtful little girl she would have waited till the bears came home and then perhaps they would have asked her to breakfast for they were good bears a little rough or so as the manner of bears is but for all that very good-natured and hospitable but the porridge looked tempting and she set about helping herself  so first she tasted the porridge of the great huge bear and that was too hot for her and then she tasted the porridge of the middle bear and that was too cold for her and then she went to the porridge of the little small wee bear and tasted that and that was neither too hot nor too cold but just right and she liked it so well that she ate it all up  then goldenlocks sat down in the chair of the great huge bear and that was too hard for her and then she sat down in the chair of the middle bear and that was too soft for her and then she sat down in the chair of the little small wee bear and that was neither too hard nor too soft but just right so she seated herself in it and there she sat till the bottom of the chair came out and down she came plump upon the ground  then goldenlocks went upstairs into the bedchamber in which the three bears slept and first she lay down upon the bed of the great huge bear but that was too high at the head for her and next she lay down upon the bed of the middle bear and that was too high at the foot for her and then she lay down upon the bed of the little small wee bear and that was neither too high at the head nor at the foot but just right so she covered herself up comfortably and lay there till she fell fast asleep  by this time the three bears thought their porridge would be cool enough so they came home to breakfast now goldenlocks had left the spoon of the great huge bear standing in his porridge  somebody has been at my porridge said the great huge bear in his great rough gruff voice and when the middle bear looked at hers she saw that the spoon was standing in it too  somebody has been at my porridge said the middle bear in her middle voice then the little small wee bear looked at his and there was the spoon in the porridge-pot but the porridge was all gone  somebody has been at my porridge and has eaten it all up said the little small wee bear in his little small wee voice  upon this the three bears seeing that someone had entered their house and eaten up the little small wee bear's breakfast began to look about them now goldenlocks had not put the hard cushion straight when she rose from the chair of the great huge bear  somebody has been sitting in my chair said the great huge bear in his great rough gruff voice  and goldenlocks had squatted down the soft cushion of the middle bear  somebody has been sitting in my chair said the middle bear in her middle voice  and you know what goldenlocks had done to the third chair  somebody has been sitting in my chair and has sat the bottom out of it said the little small wee bear in his little small wee voice  then the three bears thought it necessary that they should make farther search so they went upstairs into their bedchamber now goldenlocks had pulled the pillow of the great huge bear out of its place  somebody has been lying in my bed said the great huge bear in his great rough gruff voice  and goldenlocks had pulled the bolster of the middle bear out of its place  somebody has been lying in my bed said the middle bear in her middle voice  and when the little small wee bear came to look at his bed there was the bolster in its place and the pillow in its place upon the bolster and upon the pillow was the head of goldenlocks which was not in its place for she had no business there  somebody has been lying in my bed and here she is said the little small wee bear in his little small wee voice  goldenlocks had heard in her sleep the great rough gruff voice of the great huge bear and the middle voice of the middle bear but it was only as if she had heard someone speaking in a dream but when she heard the little small wee voice of the little small wee bear it was so sharp and so shrill that it awakened her at once up she started and when she saw the three bears on one side of the bed she tumbled herself out at the other and ran to the window now the window was open because the bears like good tidy bears as they were always opened their bedchamber window when they got up in the morning out goldenlocks jumped and ran away as fast as she could run never looking behind her and what happened to her afterwards i cannot tell but the three bears never saw anything more of her     the three little pigs   once upon a time there was an old sow with three little pigs and as she had not enough to keep them she sent them out to seek their fortune  the first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw and said to him please man give me that straw to build me a house which the man did and the little pig built a house with it presently came along a wolf and knocked at the door and said little pig little pig let me come in  to which the pig answered no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin  then i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house in said the wolf so he huffed and he puffed and he blew his house in and ate up the little pig  the second pig met a man with a bundle of furze and said please man give me that furze to build a house which the man did and the pig built his house then along came the wolf and said little pig little pig let me come in  no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin  then i'll puff and i'll huff and i'll blow your house in so he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed and at last he blew the house down and ate up the second little pig  the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks and said please man give me those bricks to build a house with so the man gave him the bricks and he built his house with them so the wolf came as he did to the other little pigs and said little pig little pig let me come in  no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin then i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house in well he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed but he could not get the house down when he found that he could not with all his huffing and puffing blow the house down he said little pig i know where there is a nice field of turnips  where said the little pig  oh in mr smith's home-field and if you will be ready to-morrow morning i will call for you and we will go together and get some for dinner  very well said the little pig i will be ready what time do you mean to go  oh at six o'clock  well the little pig got up at five and got the turnips and was home again before six when the wolf came he said little pig are you ready  ready said the little pig i have been and come back again and got a nice pot-full for dinner  the wolf felt very angry at this but thought that he would be up to the little pig somehow or other so he said little pig i know where there is a nice apple-tree where said the pig  down at merry-garden replied the wolf and if you will not deceive me i will come for you at five o'clock to-morrow and we will go together and get some apples  well the little pig woke at four the next morning and bustled up and went off for the apples hoping to get back before the wolf came but he had farther to go and had to climb the tree so that just as he was coming down from it he saw the wolf coming which as you may suppose frightened him very much when the wolf came up he said little pig what are you here before me are they nice apples  yes very said the little pig i will throw you down one and he threw it so far that while the wolf was gone to pick it up the little pig jumped down and ran home  the next day the wolf came again and said to the little pig little pig there is a fair in the town this afternoon  will you go  oh yes said the pig i will go what time shall you be ready  at three said the wolf  so the little pig went off before the time as usual and got to the fair and bought a butter churn and was on his way home with it when he saw the wolf coming then he could not tell what to do so he got into the churn to hide and in doing so turned it round and it began to roll and rolled down the hill with the pig inside it which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair  he went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him  then the little pig said hah i frightened you did i i had been to the fair and bought a butter churn and when i saw you i got into it and rolled down the hill  then the wolf was very angry indeed and declared he would eat up the little pig and that he would get down the chimney after him  when the little pig saw what he was about he hung on the pot full of water and made up a blazing fire and just as the wolf was coming down took off the cover of the pot and in fell the wolf and the little pig put on the cover again in an instant boiled him up and ate him for supper and lived happy ever after     tom thumb   long ago in the merry days of good king arthur there lived a ploughman and his wife they were very poor but would have been contented and happy if only they could have had a little child one day having heard of the great fame of the magician merlin who was living at the court of king arthur the wife persuaded her husband to go and tell him of their trouble having arrived at the court the man besought merlin with tears in his eyes to give them a child saying that they would be quite content even though it should be no bigger than his thumb merlin determined to grant the request and what was the countryman's astonishment to find when he reached home that his wife had a son who wonderful to relate was no bigger than his father's thumb  the parents were now very happy and the christening of the little fellow took place with great ceremony the fairy queen attended by all her company of elves was present at the feast she kissed the little child and giving it the name of tom thumb told her fairies to fetch the tailors of her court who dressed her little godson according to her orders his hat was made of a beautiful oak leaf his shirt of a fine spider's web and his hose and doublet were of thistledown his stockings were made with the rind of a delicate green apple and the garters were two of the finest little hairs imaginable plucked from his mother's eyebrows while his shoes were made of the skin of a little mouse when he was thus dressed the fairy queen kissed him once more and wishing him all good luck flew off with the fairies to her court  as tom grew older he became very amusing and full of tricks so that his mother was afraid to let him out of her sight one day while she was making a batter pudding tom stood on the edge of the bowl with a lighted candle in his hand so that she might see that the pudding was made properly unfortunately however when her back was turned tom fell into the bowl and his mother not missing him stirred him up in the pudding tied it in a cloth and put it into the pot the batter filled tom's mouth and prevented him from calling out but he had no sooner felt the hot water than he kicked and struggled so much that the pudding jumped about in the pot and his mother thinking the pudding was bewitched was nearly frightened out of her wits pulling it out of the pot she ran with it to her door and gave it to a tinker who was passing he was very thankful for it and looked forward to having a better dinner than he had enjoyed for many a long day but his pleasure did not last long for as he was getting over a stile he happened to sneeze very hard and tom who had been quite quiet inside the pudding for some time called out at the top of his little voice hallo pickens this so terrified the tinker that he flung away the pudding and ran off as fast as he could the pudding was all broken to pieces by the fall and tom crept out covered with batter and ran home to his mother who had been looking everywhere for him and was delighted to see him again she gave him a bath in a cup which soon washed off all the pudding and he was none the worse for his adventure  a few days after this tom accompanied his mother when she went into the fields to milk the cows and fearing he might be blown away by the wind she tied him to a sow-thistle with a little piece of thread while she was milking a cow came by bit off the thistle and swallowed up tom poor tom did not like her big teeth and called out loudly mother mother but where are you tommy my dear tommy cried out his mother wringing her hands here mother he shouted inside the red cow's mouth and saying that he began to kick and scratch till the poor cow was nearly mad and at length tumbled him out of her mouth on seeing this his mother rushed to him caught him in her arms and carried him safely home  some days after this his father took him to the fields a-ploughing and gave him a whip made of a barley straw with which to drive the oxen but little tom was soon lost in a furrow an eagle seeing him picked him up and flew with him to the top of a hill where stood a giant's castle the giant put him at once into his mouth intending to swallow him up but tom made such a great disturbance when he got inside that the monster was soon glad to get rid of him and threw him far away into the sea but he was not drowned for he had scarcely touched the water before he was swallowed by a large fish which was shortly afterwards captured and brought to king arthur as a present by the fisherman when the fish was opened everyone was astonished at finding tom inside he was at once carried to the king who made him his court dwarf      long time he lived in jollity       beloved of the court     and none like tom was so esteemed       amongst the better sort  the queen was delighted with the little boy and made him dance a gaillard on her left hand he danced so well that king arthur gave him a ring which he wore round his waist like a girdle  tom soon began to long to see his parents again and begged the king to allow him to go home for a short time this was readily permitted and the king told him he might take with him as much money as he could carry      and so away goes lusty tom       with three pence at his back      a heavy burthen which did make       his very bones to crack  he had to rest more than a hundred times by the way but after two days and two nights he reached his father's house in safety his mother saw him coming and ran out to meet him and there was great rejoicing at his arrival he spent three happy days at home and then set out for the court once more  shortly after his return he one day displeased the king so fearing the royal anger he crept into an empty flower-pot where he lay for a long time at last he ventured to peep out and seeing a fine large butterfly on the ground close by he stole out of his hiding-place jumped on its back and was carried up into the air the king and nobles all strove to catch him but at last poor tom fell from his seat into a watering-pot in which he was almost drowned only luckily the gardener's child saw him and pulled him out the king was so pleased to have him safe once more that he forgot to scold him and made much of him instead  tom afterwards lived many years at court one of the best beloved of king arthur's knights      thus he at tilt and tournament       was entertained so     that all the rest of arthur's knights       did him much pleasure show     with good sir launcelot du lake       sir tristram and sir guy     yet none compared to brave tom thumb       in acts of chivalry,the
