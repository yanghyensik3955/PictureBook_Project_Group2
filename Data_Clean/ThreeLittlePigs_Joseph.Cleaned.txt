text@the story of the three little pigs@ joseph jacobs      the story of the three little pigs   once upon a time there was an old sow with three little pigs and as she had not enough to keep them she sent them out to seek their fortune        the first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw and said to him please man give me that straw to build me a house which the man did and the little pig built a house with it presently came along a wolf and knocked at the door and said little pig little pig let me come in  to which the pig answered no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin    then i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house in said the wolf so he huffed and he puffed and he blew his house in and ate up the little pig  the second pig met a man with a bundle of furze and said please man give me that furze to build a house which the man did and the pig built his house    then along came the wolf and said little pig little pig let me come in  no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin  then i'll puff and i'll huff and i'll blow your house in so he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed and at last he blew the house down and ate up the second little pig    the third little pig met a man with a load of bricks and said please man give me those bricks to build a house with so the man gave him the bricks and he built his house with them so the wolf came as he did to the other little pigs and said little pig little pig let me come in  no no by the hair of my chinny chin chin  then i'll huff and i'll puff and i'll blow your house in  well he huffed and he puffed and he huffed and he puffed and he puffed and he huffed but he could not get the house down when he found that he could not with all his huffing and puffing blow the house down he said little pig i know where there is a nice field of turnips      where said the little pig  oh in mr smith's home-field and if you will be ready to-morrow morning i will call for you and we will go together and get some for dinner  very well said the little pig i will be ready what time do you mean to go  oh at six o'clock    well the little pig got up at five and got the turnips and was home again before six when the wolf came he said little pig are you ready  ready said the little pig i have been and come back again and got a nice pot-full for dinner      the wolf felt very angry at this but thought that he would be up to the little pig somehow or other so he said little pig i know where there is a nice apple-tree  where said the pig  down at merry-garden replied the wolf and if you will not deceive me i will come for you at five o'clock to-morrow and we will go together and get some apples    well the little pig woke at four the next morning and bustled up and went off for the apples hoping to get back before the wolf came but he had farther to go and had to climb the tree so that just as he was coming down from it he saw the wolf coming which as you may suppose frightened him very much when the wolf came up he said little pig what are you here before me are they nice apples    yes very said the little pig i will throw you down one and he threw it so far that while the wolf was gone to pick it up the little pig jumped down and ran home      the next day the wolf came again and said to the little pig little pig there is a fair in the town this afternoon  will you go  oh yes said the pig i will go what time shall you be ready  at three said the wolf    so the little pig went off before the time as usual and got to the fair and bought a butter churn and was on his way home with it when he saw the wolf coming then he could not tell what to do so he got into the churn to hide and in doing so turned it round and it began to roll and rolled down the hill with the pig inside it which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair      he went to the little pig's house and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came down the hill past him  then the little pig said hah i frightened you did i i had been to the fair and bought a butter churn and when i saw you i got into it and rolled down the hill    then the wolf was very angry indeed and declared he would eat up the little pig and that he would get down the chimney after him    when the little pig saw what he was about he hung on the pot full of water and made up a blazing fire and just as the wolf was coming down took off the cover of the pot and in fell the wolf and the little pig put on the cover again in an instant boiled him up and ate him for supper and lived happy ever after        @the three little pigs@joseph jacobs
