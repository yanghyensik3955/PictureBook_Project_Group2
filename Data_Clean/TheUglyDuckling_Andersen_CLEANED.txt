text@the ugly duckling@hans christian andersen   the ugly duckling   it was beautiful in the country it was summer-time the wheat was yellow the oats were green the hay was stacked up in the green meadows and the stork paraded about on his long red legs discoursing in egyptian which language he had learned from his mother the fields and meadows were skirted by thick woods and a deep lake lay in the midst of the woods yes it was indeed beautiful in the country the sunshine fell warmly on an old mansion surrounded by deep canals and from the walls down to the water s edge there grew large burdock-leaves so high that children could stand upright among them without being perceived this place was as wild and unfrequented as the thickest part of the wood and on that account a duck had chosen to make her nest there she was sitting on her eggs but the pleasure she had felt at first was now almost gone because she had been there so long and had so few visitors for the other ducks preferred swimming on the canals to sitting among the burdock-leaves gossiping with her  at last the eggs cracked one after another  tchick tchick  all the eggs were alive and one little head after another appeared  quack quack  said the duck and all got up as well as they could they peeped about from under the green leaves and as green is good for the eyes their mother let them look as long as they pleased   how large the world is  said the little ones for they found their present situation very different to their former confined one while yet in the egg-shells   do you imagine this to be the whole of the world  said the mother  it extends far beyond the other side of the garden to the pastor s field but i have never been there are you all here  and then she got up  no i have not got you all the largest egg is still here how long will this last i am so weary of it  and then she sat down again   well and how are you getting on  asked an old duck who had come to pay her a visit   this one egg keeps me so long  said the mother  it will not break but you should see the others they are the prettiest little ducklings i have seen in all my days they are all like their father the good-for-nothing fellow he has not been to visit me once    let me see the egg that will not break  said the old duck  depend upon it it is a turkey s egg i was cheated in the same way once myself and i had such trouble with the young ones for they were afraid of the water and i could not get them there i called and scolded but it was all of no use but let me see the egg ah yes to be sure that is a turkey s egg leave it and teach the other little ones to swim    i will sit on it a little longer  said the duck  i have been sitting so long that i may as well spend the harvest here    it is no business of mine  said the old duck and away she waddled  the great egg burst at last  tchick tchick  said the little one and out it tumbled but oh how large and ugly it was the duck looked at it  that is a great strong creature  said she  none of the others are at all like it can it be a young turkey-cock well we shall soon find out it must go into the water though i push it in myself  the next day there was delightful weather and the sun shone warmly upon all the green leaves when mother-duck with all her family went down to the canal plump she went into the water  quack quack  cried she and one duckling after another jumped in the water closed over their heads but all came up again and swam together in the pleasantest manner their legs moved without effort all were there even the ugly grey one   no it is not a turkey  said the old duck  only see how prettily it moves its legs how upright it holds itself it is my own child it is also really very pretty when one looks more closely at it quack quack now come with me i will take you into the world introduce you in the duck-yard but keep close to me or some one may tread on you and beware of the cat   so they came into the duck-yard there was a horrid noise two families were quarrelling about the remains of an eel which in the end was secured by the cat   see my children such is the way of the world  said the mother-duck wiping her beak for she too was fond of roasted eels  now use your legs  said she  keep together and bow to the old duck you see yonder she is the most distinguished of all the fowls present and is of spanish blood which accounts for her dignified appearance and manners and look she has a red rag on her leg that is considered extremely handsome and is the greatest distinction a duck can have don t turn your feet inwards a well-educated duckling always keeps his legs far apart like his father and mother just so look now bow your necks and say quack   and they did as they were told but the other ducks who were in the yard looked at them and said aloud  only see now we have another brood as if there were not enough of us already and fie how ugly that one is we will not endure it  and immediately one of the ducks flew at him and bit him in the neck   leave him alone  said the mother  he is doing no one any harm    yes but he is so large and so strange-looking and therefore he shall be teased    those are fine children that our good mother has  said the old duck with the red rag on her leg  all are pretty except one and that has not turned out well i almost wish it could be hatched over again    that cannot be please your highness  said the mother  certainly he is not handsome but he is a very good child and swims as well as the others indeed rather better i think he will grow like the others all in good time and perhaps will look smaller he stayed so long in the egg-shell that is the cause of the difference  and she scratched the duckling s neck and stroked his whole body  besides  added she  he is a drake i think he will be very strong therefore it does not matter so much he will fight his way through    the other ducks are very pretty  said the old duck  pray make yourselves at home and if you find an eel s head you can bring it to me   and accordingly they made themselves at home  but the poor little duckling who had come last out of its egg-shell and who was so ugly was bitten pecked and teased by both ducks and hens  it is so large  said they all and the turkey-cock who had come into the world with spurs on and therefore fancied he was an emperor puffed himself up like a ship in full sail and marched up to the duckling quite red with passion the poor little thing scarcely knew what to do he was quite distressed because he was so ugly and because he was the jest of the poultry-yard  [illustration  he came to a wide moor]  so passed the first day and afterwards matters grew worse and worse the poor duckling was scorned by all even his brothers and sisters behaved unkindly and were constantly saying  the cat fetch thee thou nasty creature  the mother said  ah if thou wert only far away  the ducks bit him the hens pecked him and the girl who fed the poultry kicked him he ran over the hedge the little birds in the bushes were terrified  that is because i am so ugly  thought the duckling shutting his eyes but he ran on at last he came to a wide moor where lived some wild ducks here he lay the whole night so tired and so comfortless in the morning the wild ducks flew up and perceived their new companion  pray who are you  asked they and our little duckling turned himself in all directions and greeted them as politely as possible   you are really uncommonly ugly  said the wild ducks  however that does not matter to us provided you do not marry into our families  poor thing he had never thought of marrying he only begged permission to lie among the reeds and drink the water of the moor  there he lay for two whole days on the third day there came two wild geese or rather ganders who had not been long out of their egg-shells which accounts for their impertinence   hark ye  said they  you are so ugly that we like you infinitely well will you come with us and be a bird of passage on another moor not far from this are some dear sweet wild geese as lovely creatures as have ever said hiss hiss you are truly in the way to make your fortune ugly as you are   bang a gun went off all at once and both wild geese were stretched dead among the reeds the water became red with blood bang a gun went off again whole flocks of wild geese flew up from among the reeds and another report followed  there was a grand hunting party  the hunters lay in ambush all around some were even sitting in the trees whose huge branches stretched far over the moor the blue smoke rose through the thick trees like a mist and was dispersed as it fell over the water the hounds splashed about in the mud the reeds and rushes bent in all directions how frightened the poor little duck was he turned his head thinking to hide it under his wings and in a moment a most formidable-looking dog stood close to him his tongue hanging out of his mouth his eyes sparkling fearfully he opened wide his jaws at the sight of our duckling showed him his sharp white teeth and splash splash he was gone gone without hurting him   well let me be thankful  sighed he  i am so ugly that even the dog will not eat me   and now he lay still though the shooting continued among the reeds shot following shot  the noise did not cease till late in the day and even then the poor little thing dared not stir he waited several hours before he looked around him and then hastened away from the moor as fast as he could he ran over fields and meadows though the wind was so high that he had some difficulty in proceeding  towards evening he reached a wretched little hut so wretched that it knew not on which side to fall and therefore remained standing the wind blew violently so that our poor little duckling was obliged to support himself on his tail in order to stand against it but it became worse and worse he then remarked that the door had lost one of its hinges and hung so much awry that he could creep through the crevice into the room which he did  in this room lived an old woman with her tom-cat and her hen and the cat whom she called her little son knew how to set up his back and purr indeed he could even emit sparks when stroked the wrong way the hen had very short legs and was therefore called  cuckoo shortlegs  she laid very good eggs and the old woman loved her as her own child  the next morning the new guest was perceived the cat began to mew and the hen to cackle   what is the matter  asked the old woman looking round however her eyes were not good so she took the young duckling to be a fat duck who had lost her way  this is a capital catch  said she  i shall now have duck s eggs if it be not a drake  we must try   and so the duckling was put to the proof for three weeks but no eggs made their appearance  now the cat was the master of the house and the hen was the mistress and they used always to say  we and the world  for they imagined themselves to be not only the half of the world but also by far the better half the duckling thought it was possible to be of a different opinion but that the hen would not allow   can you lay eggs  asked she   no    well then hold your tongue   and the cat said  can you set up your back can you purr    no    well then you should have no opinion when reasonable persons are speaking   so the duckling sat alone in a corner and was in a very bad humour however he happened to think of the fresh air and bright sunshine and these thoughts gave him such a strong desire to swim again that he could not help telling it to the hen   what ails you  said the hen  you have nothing to do and therefore brood over these fancies either lay eggs or purr then you will forget them    but it is so delicious to swim  said the duckling  so delicious when the waters close over your head and you plunge to the bottom    well that is a queer sort of a pleasure  said the hen  i think you must be crazy not to speak of myself ask the cat he is the most sensible animal i know whether he would like to swim or to plunge to the bottom of the water ask our mistress the old woman there is no one in the world wiser than she do you think she would take pleasure in swimming and in the waters closing over her head    you do not understand me  said the duckling   what we do not understand you so you think yourself wiser than the cat and the old woman not to speak of myself do not fancy any such thing child but be thankful for all the kindness that has been shown you are you not lodged in a warm room and have you not the advantage of society from which you can learn something but you are a simpleton and it is wearisome to have anything to do with you believe me i wish you well i tell you unpleasant truths but it is thus that real friendship is shown come for once give yourself the trouble to learn to purr or to lay eggs    i think i will go out into the wide world again  said the duckling   well go  answered the hen  so the duckling went he swam on the surface of the water he plunged beneath but all animals passed him by on account of his ugliness and the autumn came the leaves turned yellow and brown the wind caught them and danced them about the air was very cold the clouds were heavy with hail or snow and the raven sat on the hedge and croaked  the poor duckling was certainly not very comfortable  one evening just as the sun was setting with unusual brilliancy a flock of large beautiful birds rose from out of the brushwood the duckling had never seen anything so beautiful before their plumage was of a dazzling white and they had long slender necks they were swans they uttered a singular cry spread out their long splendid wings and flew away from these cold regions to warmer countries across the open sea they flew so high so very high and the little ugly duckling s feelings were so strange he turned round and round in the water like a mill-wheel strained his neck to look after them and sent forth such a loud and strange cry that it almost frightened himself ah he could not forget them those noble  [illustration  and the cat said  can you purr ]  birds those happy birds when he could see them no longer he plunged to the bottom of the water and when he rose again was almost beside himself the duckling knew not what the birds were called knew not whither they were flying yet he loved them as he had never before loved anything he envied them not it would never have occurred to him to wish such beauty for himself he would have been quite contented if the duck in the duck-yard had but endured his company the poor ugly animal  and the winter was so cold so cold the duckling was obliged to swim round and round in the water to keep it from freezing but every night the opening in which he swam became smaller and smaller it froze so that the crust of ice crackled the duckling was obliged to make good use of his legs to prevent the water from freezing entirely at last wearied out he lay stiff and cold in the ice  early in the morning there passed by a peasant who saw him broke the ice in pieces with his wooden shoe and brought him home to his wife  he now revived the children would have played with him but our duckling thought they wished to tease him and in his terror jumped into the milk-pail so that the milk was spilled about the room  the good woman screamed and clapped her hands he flew thence into the pan where the butter was kept and thence into the meal-barrel and out again and then how strange he looked  the woman screamed and struck at him with the tongs the children ran races with each other trying to catch him and laughed and screamed likewise it was well for him that the door stood open he jumped out among the bushes into the new-fallen snow he lay there as in a dream  but it would be too melancholy to relate all the trouble and misery that he was obliged to suffer during the severity of the winter he was lying on a moor among the reeds when the sun began to shine warmly again the larks sang and beautiful spring had returned  and once more he shook his wings they were stronger than formerly and bore him forwards quickly and before he was well aware of it he was in a large garden where the apple-trees stood in full bloom where the syringas sent forth their fragrance and hung their long green branches down into the winding canal oh everything was so lovely so full of the freshness of spring and out of the thicket came three beautiful white swans they displayed their feathers so proudly and swam so lightly so lightly the duckling knew the glorious creatures and was seized with a strange melancholy   i will fly to them those kingly birds  said he  they will kill me because i ugly as i am have presumed to approach them but it matters not better to be killed by them than to be bitten by the ducks pecked by the hens kicked by the girl who feeds the poultry and to have so much to suffer during the winter  he flew into the water and swam towards the beautiful creatures they saw him and shot forward to meet him  only kill me  said the poor animal and he bowed his head low expecting death but what did he see in the water he saw beneath him his own form no longer that of a plump ugly grey bird it was that of a swan  it matters not to have been born in a duck-yard if one has been hatched from a swan s egg  the good creature felt himself really elevated by all the troubles and adversities he had experienced he could now rightly estimate his own happiness and the larger swans swam round him and stroked him with their beaks  some little children were running about in the garden  [illustration  and every one said  the new one is the best ]  they threw grain and bread into the water and the youngest exclaimed  there is a new one  the others also cried out  yes there is a new swan come  and they clapped their hands and danced around they ran to their father and mother bread and cake were thrown into the water and every one said  the new one is the best so young and so beautiful  and the old swans bowed before him the young swan felt quite ashamed and hid his head under his wings he scarcely knew what to do he was all too happy but still not proud for a good heart is never proud  he remembered how he had been persecuted and derided and he now heard every one say he was the most beautiful of all beautiful birds the syringas bent down their branches towards him low into the water and the sun shone so warmly and brightly he shook his feathers stretched his slender neck and in the joy of his heart said  how little did i dream of so much happiness when i was the ugly despised duckling   @the ugly duckling@hans christian
