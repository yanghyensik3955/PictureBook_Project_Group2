text@pinocchio@carlo collodi chapter 1   how it happened that mastro cherry carpenter found a piece of wood that wept and laughed like a child  centuries ago there lived   a king my little readers will say immediately  no children you are mistaken once upon a time there was a piece of wood it was not an expensive piece of wood far from it just a common block of firewood one of those thick solid logs that are put on the fire in winter to make cold rooms cozy and warm  i do not know how this really happened yet the fact remains that one fine day this piece of wood found itself in the shop of an old carpenter his real name was mastro antonio but everyone called him mastro cherry for the tip of his nose was so round and red and shiny that it looked like a ripe cherry  as soon as he saw that piece of wood mastro cherry was filled with joy rubbing his hands together happily he mumbled half to himself   this has come in the nick of time i shall use it to make the leg of a table  he grasped the hatchet quickly to peel off the bark and shape the wood but as he was about to give it the first blow he stood still with arm uplifted for he had heard a wee little voice say in a beseeching tone  please be careful do not hit me so hard  what a look of surprise shone on mastro cherry’s face his funny face became still funnier  he turned frightened eyes about the room to find out where that wee little voice had come from and he saw no one he looked under the bench no one he peeped inside the closet no one he searched among the shavings no one he opened the door to look up and down the street and still no one  oh i see he then said laughing and scratching his wig it can easily be seen that i only thought i heard the tiny voice say the words well well to work once more  he struck a most solemn blow upon the piece of wood  oh oh you hurt cried the same far-away little voice  mastro cherry grew dumb his eyes popped out of his head his mouth opened wide and his tongue hung down on his chin  as soon as he regained the use of his senses he said trembling and stuttering from fright   where did that voice come from when there is no one around might it be that this piece of wood has learned to weep and cry like a child i can hardly believe it here it is a piece of common firewood good only to burn in the stove the same as any other yet might someone be hidden in it if so the worse for him i’ll fix him  with these words he grabbed the log with both hands and started to knock it about unmercifully he threw it to the floor against the walls of the room and even up to the ceiling  he listened for the tiny voice to moan and cry he waited two minutes nothing five minutes nothing ten minutes nothing  oh i see he said trying bravely to laugh and ruffling up his wig with his hand it can easily be seen i only imagined i heard the tiny voice well well to work once more  the poor fellow was scared half to death so he tried to sing a gay song in order to gain courage  he set aside the hatchet and picked up the plane to make the wood smooth and even but as he drew it to and fro he heard the same tiny voice this time it giggled as it spoke   stop it oh stop it ha ha ha you tickle my stomach  this time poor mastro cherry fell as if shot when he opened his eyes he found himself sitting on the floor  his face had changed fright had turned even the tip of his nose from red to deepest purple     chapter 2  mastro cherry gives the piece of wood to his friend geppetto who takes it to make himself a marionette that will dance fence and turn somersaults   in that very instant a loud knock sounded on the door come in said the carpenter not having an atom of strength left with which to stand up  at the words the door opened and a dapper little old man came in his name was geppetto but to the boys of the neighborhood he was polendina on account of the wig he always wore which was just the color of yellow corn        cornmeal mush  geppetto had a very bad temper woe to the one who called him polendina he became as wild as a beast and no one could soothe him  good day mastro antonio said geppetto what are you doing on the floor  i am teaching the ants their a b c’s  good luck to you  what brought you here friend geppetto  my legs and it may flatter you to know mastro antonio that i have come to you to beg for a favor  here i am at your service answered the carpenter raising himself on to his knees  this morning a fine idea came to me  let’s hear it  i thought of making myself a beautiful wooden marionette it must be wonderful one that will be able to dance fence and turn somersaults with it i intend to go around the world to earn my crust of bread and cup of wine what do you think of it  bravo polendina cried the same tiny voice which came from no one knew where  on hearing himself called polendina mastro geppetto turned the color of a red pepper and facing the carpenter said to him angrily   why do you insult me  who is insulting you  you called me polendina  i did not  i suppose you think i did yet i know it was you  no  yes  no  yes  and growing angrier each moment they went from words to blows and finally began to scratch and bite and slap each other  when the fight was over mastro antonio had geppetto’s yellow wig in his hands and geppetto found the carpenter’s curly wig in his mouth  give me back my wig shouted mastro antonio in a surly voice  you return mine and we’ll be friends  the two little old men each with his own wig back on his own head shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives  well then mastro geppetto said the carpenter to show he bore him no ill will what is it you want  i want a piece of wood to make a marionette will you give it to me  mastro antonio very glad indeed went immediately to his bench to get the piece of wood which had frightened him so much but as he was about to give it to his friend with a violent jerk it slipped out of his hands and hit against poor geppetto’s thin legs  ah is this the gentle way mastro antonio in which you make your gifts you have made me almost lame  i swear to you i did not do it  it was i of course  it’s the fault of this piece of wood  you’re right but remember you were the one to throw it at my legs  i did not throw it  liar  geppetto do not insult me or i shall call you polendina  idiot  polendina  donkey  polendina  ugly monkey  polendina  on hearing himself called polendina for the third time geppetto lost his head with rage and threw himself upon the carpenter then and there they gave each other a sound thrashing  after this fight mastro antonio had two more scratches on his nose and geppetto had two buttons missing from his coat thus having settled their accounts they shook hands and swore to be good friends for the rest of their lives  then geppetto took the fine piece of wood thanked mastro antonio and limped away toward home@pinocchio@carlo collodi
